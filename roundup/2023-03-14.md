# Roundup IRC Log for 2023-03-14
* <a href="#15:41.28" id="15:41.28">15:41.28 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi jerrykan and nomicon. Sorry I missed the discussion.

* <a href="#15:42.40" id="15:42.40">15:42.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Jerrykan, I think direct serving of assets is for css/javascript/images  (e.g. background images) that are part of the interface. Compare that to an attached file.

* <a href="#15:44.08" id="15:44.08">15:44.08 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If your tracker is public and no attached files/images are hidden from the anonymous user, then serving the files outside of Roundup's authorization system makes sense.

* <a href="#15:45.20" id="15:45.20">15:45.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so tracker/@@file/... and tracker/file30 can both be served by nginx/apache/etc.

* <a href="#15:47.08" id="15:47.08">15:47.08 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: However if you have an authorization mechanism (e.g. a private security related ticket) that restricts access to the ticket and its attachments to certain users you need some way to expose

* <a href="#15:47.32" id="15:47.32">15:47.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that authorization to the service serving up the atachment.

* <a href="#15:49.26" id="15:49.26">15:49.26 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also for attachments, they do not have file extensions. So browser's mime sniffing needs to be deployed.

* <a href="#15:52.51" id="15:52.51">15:52.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The technique I posted on the wiki allows reducing a 500KB png to 10KB webp while signing the URL so that the image server knows that it was authorized. The URL expires after 10 seconds which

* <a href="#15:53.41" id="15:53.41">15:53.41 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: allows viewing it in the issue, but prevents access to the image by replaying it > 10 seconds in the future.
* <a href="#15:54.36" id="15:54.36">15:54.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: This came up because the tracker displayed the images inline in the ticket at the end of the update note. There were a lot of images....

* <a href="#15:56.58" id="15:56.58">15:56.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan, I would be interested in how your apache is configured to serve up files direct from db/files/X/fileYY how does it know what mime type to serve? Does the browser sniff the image to figure out how to display it?

* <a href="#20:55.32" id="20:55.32">20:55.32 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: I was mainly referring to the css/javascript/image assets being served up via Apache (ie. using `Alias /foo/@@file/ /srv/roundup/foo/html/` as mention in the docs).

* <a href="#20:59.38" id="20:59.38">20:59.38 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: The file objects in the db/ directory just get served up via Roundup.

* <a href="#21:09.02" id="21:09.02">21:09.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan ack. That's the method I am familiar with.
* <a href="#21:09.10" id="21:09.10">21:09.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s/the/a/
* <a href="#21:09.18" id="21:09.18">21:09.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thanks for the reply.
