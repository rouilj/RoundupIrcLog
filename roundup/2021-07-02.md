* <a href="#17:57.07" id="17:57.07">17:57.07 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I sent you an email with those paragraphs about migration I promised.
* <a href="#19:06.56" id="19:06.56">19:06.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump thanks. That's great. If you are on the roundup-users's list that would be a great thing to post. Try to get a few more people converting. Also did you turn on csrf defenses? Di you find any issues in the upgrading documentation that were confusing?
* <a href="#19:08.07" id="19:08.07">19:08.07 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also there were fixes associated with the import bug. I think I refer to you as hefflump in the doc. Would you like me to use your real name?
