* <a href="#18:30.47" id="18:30.47">18:30.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] I am rewriting docs referencing run_tests.py. I see pytest, py.test and pythonX -m pytest it looks like all work, and the pythonX -m pytest has the advantage that the version of python used is made explicit. So I am looking at using it.  Any reason I shouldn't avocate: 'pip3 install pytest; python3 -m pytest' (or euiv for python2) in the top level roundup source directory as a replacement for run_tests.py.
