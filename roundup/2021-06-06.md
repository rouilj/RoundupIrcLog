# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-06
* <a href="#04:31.42" id="04:31.42">04:31.42 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I'm looking at a few examples now:
* <a href="#04:32.44" id="04:32.44">04:32.44 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: one case: two entries both with __retired__=True, ordering has the higher id before the lower id
* <a href="#04:34.29" id="04:34.29">04:34.29 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: another case (this is a spammer so we don't actually care about it): 6 entries, 5 __retired__=True then 1 __retired__=False. Ids are 2039,2583,2580,2581,2584,2600
* <a href="#04:34.56" id="04:34.56">04:34.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: if I understand you correctly you think that sorting the csv by id might fix the problem in itself? I can try that easily.
* <a href="#04:42.38" id="04:42.38">04:42.38 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: new error (from 1.4.15 still):
* <a href="#04:42.47" id="04:42.47">04:42.47 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: KeyError: '(2005, 10, 29, 17, 28, 11.859999, 0, 0, 0)'
* <a href="#04:43.13" id="04:43.13">04:43.13 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: there are quite a lot of time entries with badly rounded FP numbers, dunno if it's something to do with that. I suspect more munging will be needed :-)
* <a href="#04:43.56" id="04:43.56">04:43.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: no, even 11.86 fails
* <a href="#04:46.04" id="04:46.04">04:46.04 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: and same error from 2.0.0
* <a href="#04:46.24" id="04:46.24">04:46.24 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: oh, wait, the sort will have screwed up the header
* <a href="#04:49.05" id="04:49.05">04:49.05 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: ok. Same UNIQUE constraint failure with the rows sorted by id (i.e. field 7 in the CSV, counting from 1)
* <a href="#04:49.16" id="04:49.16">04:49.16 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: with both 1.4.15 and 2.0.0.
* <a href="#04:59.23" id="04:59.23">04:59.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I guess overall I don't understand why you think sorting by id might help. If there's a duplicated username+is retired in the CSV, no matter what the order, isn't that always going to cause a problem?
