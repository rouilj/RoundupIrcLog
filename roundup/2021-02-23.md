* <a href="#16:23.23" id="16:23.23">16:23.23 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, the last error mail I received was from mid-october
* <a href="#16:28.36" id="16:28.36">16:28.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, ok. Something wacky is happening there. In any case, what about cleaning up and setting a template for the infrastructure tracker. Also possible sponsor for docs for roundup?
* <a href="#16:31.01" id="16:31.01">16:31.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I guess that would help
* <a href="#16:31.10" id="16:31.10">16:31.10 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there are a few other trackers/repo that might be affected
* <a href="#16:31.27" id="16:31.27">16:31.27 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ???
* <a href="#16:32.06" id="16:32.06">16:32.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: infrastructure tracker on github is what I mean. However I think looking at logging for bpo and other trackers would be useful. I would be happy to help with upkeep
* <a href="#16:32.14" id="16:32.14">16:32.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: on those if I can see the errors.
