* <a href="#10:05.27" id="10:05.27">10:05.27 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I finally got round to sending that migration report to the list btw.
* <a href="#11:07.18" id="11:07.18">11:07.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, I saw the mailing list post. Thanks. I'm going to be afk over the next week. My dad died on thursday so I am dealing with arrangements etc.
