I have the server running on port 8080 and I can see GET requests coming in, but does not return anything back to the browser
* <a href="#14:19.38" id="14:19.38">14:19.38 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: no error messages are being logged

* <a href="#14:20.51" id="14:20.51">14:20.51 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: any advice how I can go about debugging this? I even go mail working where I saw roundup send a message about a database access (which I fixed)
* <a href="#14:37.19" id="14:37.19">14:37.19 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: qwebirc76818: I'm sorry, but I'm not up to date enough to be useful.  The people you most want help from are, I think, not in my time zone, so if you are patient and hang out for a few hours you'll probably get a useful answer.
* <a href="#15:07.20" id="15:07.20">15:07.20 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: Well thank you for your response anyway. I just can't seem to get any logging or debugging information that might be useful.
* <a href="#15:08.53" id="15:08.53">15:08.53 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: tcpdump -i eth0 tcp port 8080 shows incoming data but nothing seems to get back to the browser (or postman or curl)
* <a href="#15:09.40" id="15:09.40">15:09.40 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: curl returns a 301 with "curl -X GET http://10.0.8.63:8080/support
* <a href="#15:10.39" id="15:10.39">15:10.39 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: curl returns "curl: (52) Empty reply from server" when I use:  curl -X GET http://10.0.8.63:8080/support/   (adding a final "/")
* <a href="#15:11.04" id="15:11.04">15:11.04 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj, at least, will have some useful feedback when he reappears.
* <a href="#15:15.28" id="15:15.28">15:15.28 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: I got it!
* <a href="#15:15.54" id="15:15.54">15:15.54 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: I set ownership of all files to my non-root user "roundup" and bingo it came up
* <a href="#15:16.07" id="15:16.07">15:16.07 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: so the documenation is really weak in some areas, like this
* <a href="#15:16.23" id="15:16.23">15:16.23 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc76818](https://github.com/qwebirc76818)__: just a pointer. I am anxious to try it out!
* <a href="#16:09.26" id="16:09.26">16:09.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: grr, wanted to ask qwebirc76818 where he thought the docs could be improved. Sounds like roundup tracker dir was not accessible/writable by the user running the app.
* <a href="#16:13.45" id="16:13.45">16:13.45 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I may see if I can replicate, but my first suggestion would have been to enable [web] debug option in config.ini to get traceback in the browser. It is off by default so it doesn't leak info about paths etc. But in this case where the log file may not be writable, it may return something useful.
* <a href="#16:15.09" id="16:15.09">16:15.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: HedgeMage I am in UTC-5 EST you are UTC -6 right?
* <a href="#16:15.40" id="16:15.40">16:15.40 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: I'm EST as well.  For some reason, I thought you were Mountain Time.
* <a href="#16:15.54" id="16:15.54">16:15.54 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: I must be crazy. ;)
* <a href="#16:25.51" id="16:25.51">16:25.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Nope, just outside of Boston. To get to mountains I have to travel 45 minutes west 8-).
* <a href="#16:26.28" id="16:26.28">16:26.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So both out geolocators are off. I thought you were more midwest.
* <a href="#16:32.04" id="16:32.04">16:32.04 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: I am in the midwest.  Indiana is on Eastern time except for one county.
* <a href="#16:32.30" id="16:32.30">16:32.30 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: One of my beloveds, and thus a second home for me, are in Acton, so we should visit sometime when I'm out there.
* <a href="#16:37.30" id="16:37.30">16:37.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Definately. I think we discussed that before. Once everybody has their shots (I am behind on my distemper shots apparently 8-)).
* <a href="#16:38.20" id="16:38.20">16:38.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Is Indiana right on the EST/CST line?
* <a href="#16:39.55" id="16:39.55">16:39.55 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Yes.  Illinois and neighbors are all CST, which is why one Indiana county is as well (they are mainly a commuter hub for Chicago).  Ohio, Kentucky, and our neighbors that way are EST.
* <a href="#16:40.48" id="16:40.48">16:40.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ok, that explains my confusion.
* <a href="#16:42.00" id="16:42.00">16:42.00 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: Also, until a few years ago (almost a decade now), Indiana had 43 time zones and made zero sense in this regard.
* <a href="#16:42.20" id="16:42.20">16:42.20 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Actually, it might be just over a decade now.
* <a href="#16:42.34" id="16:42.34">16:42.34 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Anyway, circa 2008-2011 it changed to something sane.
* <a href="#16:42.45" id="16:42.45">16:42.45 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: They used to let counties and parts of counties make up their own time zones.
* <a href="#16:42.56" id="16:42.56">16:42.56 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: You could change TZ three times on your daily commute!
