# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-08-31
* <a href="#04:06.09" id="04:06.09">04:06.09 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: this is hopefully a easy question for you to answer =) with roundup-admin I can generate a list of users with 'roundup-admin -i <tracker home> get admincontact $id' and it will return med with a list of user id's. In next turn I want to feed this list to get the email address belonging to each user
