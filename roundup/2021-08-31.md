# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-08-31
* <a href="#04:06.09" id="04:06.09">04:06.09 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: this is hopefully a easy question for you to answer =) with roundup-admin I can generate a list of users with 'roundup-admin -i <tracker home> get admincontact $id' and it will return med with a list of user id's. In next turn I want to feed this list to get the email address belonging to each user
* <a href="#06:38.35" id="06:38.35">06:38.35 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: nomicon: I don't think there is any way to do that using just `round-admin`, you would need to script something up in python... or bash
* <a href="#09:34.58" id="09:34.58">09:34.58 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: jerrykan[m]: yeah I solved it, thanks..
* <a href="#09:35.23" id="09:35.23">09:35.23 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: now im trying to wrap my head around this html templating thingy, banging my head at something I thought would be fairly simple
* <a href="#09:37.15" id="09:37.15">09:37.15 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <td tal:define="admincontact python:sa.admincontact.plain()" tal:content="python:db._db.user.filter_sql('select id, _username, _address from _user where _username = %s' % ( admincontact ))"></td>
* <a href="#09:37.27" id="09:37.27">09:37.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: psycopg2.ProgrammingError: column "etunamats" does not exist
* <a href="#09:37.28" id="09:37.28">09:37.28 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: LINE 1: ..., _username, _address from _user where _username = etunamats
* <a href="#09:37.50" id="09:37.50">09:37.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: where "etunamats" is value from admincontact
* <a href="#09:38.51" id="09:38.51">09:38.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, yeah jerrykan is right. need to script in bash. There is an example at the bottom of the user_guide.
* <a href="#09:39.03" id="09:39.03">09:39.03 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: yeah got it working bash
* <a href="#09:40.46" id="09:40.46">09:40.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you need to quote the %s. You are writing sql and the filter term needs to be quoted.
* <a href="#09:41.11" id="09:41.11">09:41.11 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: yeah i've tried quoting it in all possible ways (or so it feels like) :)
* <a href="#09:43.37" id="09:43.37">09:43.37 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I would make it into a utility function in python.
* <a href="#09:44.36" id="09:44.36">09:44.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: let me see if I can come up with an alternative, it seems it should be doable in the template but....
* <a href="#09:45.31" id="09:45.31">09:45.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: does this help? <tal:block tal:repeat="userdata python:db._db.user.filter_sql('select id,_username from _user where _roles like \'%Developer%\' order by _username')">
* <a href="#09:45.50" id="09:45.50">09:45.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: cool. could you point me to, or give me some hints about that utility function? I guess I just create a pythonscript in extensions/ perhaps, and then import/call that somewhow from the .html ?
* <a href="#09:46.35" id="09:46.35">09:46.35 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I think that does not help, I saw that earlier.. my problem is with the %s and probably pgsql
* <a href="#09:46.56" id="09:46.56">09:46.56 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: i tried _username = \'%s\'' and all combinations there of
* <a href="#09:47.20" id="09:47.20">09:47.20 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I either get a column ".." does not exists from pgsql, or some syntax error from templating engine
* <a href="#09:47.31" id="09:47.31">09:47.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct. search for totalTimeSpent in the customizing document.
* <a href="#09:47.56" id="09:47.56">09:47.56 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Thank you, I will do that. work day is almost over, time to punch the time card and gtfo =)
* <a href="#09:48.57" id="09:48.57">09:48.57 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: did you try = \'%s\';'
* <a href="#09:49.29" id="09:49.29">09:49.29 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: psycopg2.ProgrammingError: syntax error at or near "behrent"
* <a href="#09:49.29" id="09:49.29">09:49.29 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: LINE 1: ..._username, _address from _user where _username = ''behrent';
* <a href="#09:49.38" id="09:49.38">09:49.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: i.e. terminate the sql statement with a semicolon? It should be terminated anyway because of how it's called but....
* <a href="#09:49.38" id="09:49.38">09:49.38 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I get a double quote in the beginning
* <a href="#09:50.26" id="09:50.26">09:50.26 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: does your username have a ' in it? what you are showing is "behrent' or ''behrent' which won;t work.
