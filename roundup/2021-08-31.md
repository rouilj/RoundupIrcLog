# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-08-31
* <a href="#04:06.09" id="04:06.09">04:06.09 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: this is hopefully a easy question for you to answer =) with roundup-admin I can generate a list of users with 'roundup-admin -i <tracker home> get admincontact $id' and it will return med with a list of user id's. In next turn I want to feed this list to get the email address belonging to each user
* <a href="#06:38.35" id="06:38.35">06:38.35 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: nomicon: I don't think there is any way to do that using just `round-admin`, you would need to script something up in python... or bash
* <a href="#09:34.58" id="09:34.58">09:34.58 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: jerrykan[m]: yeah I solved it, thanks..
* <a href="#09:35.23" id="09:35.23">09:35.23 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: now im trying to wrap my head around this html templating thingy, banging my head at something I thought would be fairly simple
* <a href="#09:37.15" id="09:37.15">09:37.15 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <td tal:define="admincontact python:sa.admincontact.plain()" tal:content="python:db._db.user.filter_sql('select id, _username, _address from _user where _username = %s' % ( admincontact ))"></td>
* <a href="#09:37.27" id="09:37.27">09:37.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: psycopg2.ProgrammingError: column "etunamats" does not exist
* <a href="#09:37.28" id="09:37.28">09:37.28 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: LINE 1: ..., _username, _address from _user where _username = etunamats
* <a href="#09:37.50" id="09:37.50">09:37.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: where "etunamats" is value from admincontact
* <a href="#09:38.51" id="09:38.51">09:38.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, yeah jerrykan is right. need to script in bash. There is an example at the bottom of the user_guide.
* <a href="#09:39.03" id="09:39.03">09:39.03 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: yeah got it working bash
* <a href="#09:40.46" id="09:40.46">09:40.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you need to quote the %s. You are writing sql and the filter term needs to be quoted.
* <a href="#09:41.11" id="09:41.11">09:41.11 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: yeah i've tried quoting it in all possible ways (or so it feels like) :)
* <a href="#09:43.37" id="09:43.37">09:43.37 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I would make it into a utility function in python.
* <a href="#09:44.36" id="09:44.36">09:44.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: let me see if I can come up with an alternative, it seems it should be doable in the template but....
* <a href="#09:45.31" id="09:45.31">09:45.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: does this help? <tal:block tal:repeat="userdata python:db._db.user.filter_sql('select id,_username from _user where _roles like \'%Developer%\' order by _username')">
* <a href="#09:45.50" id="09:45.50">09:45.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: cool. could you point me to, or give me some hints about that utility function? I guess I just create a pythonscript in extensions/ perhaps, and then import/call that somewhow from the .html ?
* <a href="#09:46.35" id="09:46.35">09:46.35 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I think that does not help, I saw that earlier.. my problem is with the %s and probably pgsql
* <a href="#09:46.56" id="09:46.56">09:46.56 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: i tried _username = \'%s\'' and all combinations there of
* <a href="#09:47.20" id="09:47.20">09:47.20 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I either get a column ".." does not exists from pgsql, or some syntax error from templating engine
* <a href="#09:47.31" id="09:47.31">09:47.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct. search for totalTimeSpent in the customizing document.
* <a href="#09:47.56" id="09:47.56">09:47.56 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Thank you, I will do that. work day is almost over, time to punch the time card and gtfo =)
* <a href="#09:48.57" id="09:48.57">09:48.57 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: did you try = \'%s\';'
* <a href="#09:49.29" id="09:49.29">09:49.29 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: psycopg2.ProgrammingError: syntax error at or near "behrent"
* <a href="#09:49.29" id="09:49.29">09:49.29 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: LINE 1: ..._username, _address from _user where _username = ''behrent';
* <a href="#09:49.38" id="09:49.38">09:49.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: i.e. terminate the sql statement with a semicolon? It should be terminated anyway because of how it's called but....
* <a href="#09:49.38" id="09:49.38">09:49.38 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I get a double quote in the beginning
* <a href="#09:50.26" id="09:50.26">09:50.26 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: does your username have a ' in it? what you are showing is "behrent' or ''behrent' which won;t work.
* <a href="#09:51.15" id="09:51.15">09:51.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: what you pasted looks like two ' if the username has a ' that would explain it.
* <a href="#09:51.54" id="09:51.54">09:51.54 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: while im not 100% sure, i dont beleve so, because then our tracker would for sure have exploded many years ago =)
* <a href="#09:52.17" id="09:52.17">09:52.17 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I think its an artifact from that pgsql also do some adding ticks
* <a href="#09:52.43" id="09:52.43">09:52.43 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I stumbled something upon that topic after googling a few hours ago
* <a href="#09:54.50" id="09:54.50">09:54.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41804213/psycopg2-programmingerror-column-your-name-does-not-exist>
* <a href="#09:55.00" id="09:55.00">09:55.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah, that's weird. if you don't have any luck try emailing the roundup_users list. with a description of what your goal is, your input, and the error output. There are a few people better versed in TAL  on the mailing list who may have found/solved this problem. Also there may be an easier way to get what you want. I have done a fair amount of templating/iterating etc and never resorted to filter_sql (becaue I wanted my templates
* <a href="#09:55.00" id="09:55.00">09:55.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: rk on a nosql database as well)..
* <a href="#09:55.22" id="09:55.22">09:55.22 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: this guy gets the same problem as me, with column does not exist, but I've not been able to implement the proposed solution into a valid tal syntax
* <a href="#09:56.12" id="09:56.12">09:56.12 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: right. I will spend some time with the utility function instead, seems like a smoother soltuion for me (atleast for now), since im not best friend with tal just yet =)
* <a href="#09:57.08" id="09:57.08">09:57.08 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: kind of pain when i'm not used to either python, roundup or tal :)
* <a href="#09:57.50" id="09:57.50">09:57.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: 13 different developers (according to svn log) has been hacking'away on our roundup over the last 15 years..
* <a href="#09:58.06" id="09:58.06">09:58.06 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: im opening a can of worms here
* <a href="#09:58.46" id="09:58.46">09:58.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: are you implementing something that already worked (but has failed wen you upgraded??) or are you doing something new?
* <a href="#09:59.54" id="09:59.54">09:59.54 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: something new
* <a href="#10:00.44" id="10:00.44">10:00.44 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: We have our own class for support agreements, and a view where our ceo can view a list of active agreements, customer name and some other meta data. I want to add admin contact email to that view, which is stored in user class
* <a href="#10:01.35" id="10:01.35">10:01.35 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: also just realised I need to create an "Download as CSV" for that view.. :/
* <a href="#10:21.23" id="10:21.23">10:21.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: regarding the link you sent yeah using %s in a sql statement isn't a good idea. Opens the door wide for sql injection.
