# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-12-21
* <a href="#01:36.36" id="01:36.36">01:36.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] are you still buried in log4j issues or did you have a chance to look into a setuptools equivalent for: from distutils.command.build import build
* <a href="#02:12.40" id="02:12.40">02:12.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: here's a fun one. Python2's cgi.py calls readline with a max char read size. readline(a<<16). howevr under wsgi it looks like the wsgi.input readline doesn't support the max number of chars to read and it crashes.....
* <a href="#02:13.15" id="02:13.15">02:13.15 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: any pythonista's that can explain why this happens and a way around it?
* <a href="#02:14.33" id="02:14.33">02:14.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] fyi this is in the test suite running your wsgi_liveserver implementation. Not sure if that's contributing.
* <a href="#02:19.42" id="02:19.42">02:19.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nevermind. Apprently it's caused by wsgiref/validate.py the readline defined by the InputWrapper class doesn;t support the extra param. The 3.6 version does. So one item down.
* <a href="#20:53.09" id="20:53.09">20:53.09 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: Haven't had a change to look yet.
* <a href="#20:55.12" id="20:55.12">20:55.12 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: heh, didn't realise that wsgi-liveserver has been pulled in.
* <a href="#20:59.33" id="20:59.33">20:59.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Added it back in April. It's been useful for verifying proper compression of data and etag generation, headers for OPTIONS requests, if modified since testing, cache settings.
* <a href="#21:01.27" id="21:01.27">21:01.27 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: You may just want to check the how the license (GPL) affects the roundup license (MIT?).
* <a href="#21:02.20" id="21:02.20">21:02.20 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I'd be happy to sign off on the GPL aspects reaching as far as the roundup test suite if that is required.
* <a href="#21:03.13" id="21:03.13">21:03.13 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: ... though I think there may have been a patch from someone else, so that may complicate things as well
* <a href="#21:05.32" id="21:05.32">21:05.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well it's part of the test suite and not roundup propper.
* <a href="#21:06.17" id="21:06.17">21:06.17 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so I don't think it's license needs to be incorporated in the overall license doc.
* <a href="#21:08.16" id="21:08.16">21:08.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: But I can add it if you think differently.
* <a href="#21:09.27" id="21:09.27">21:09.27 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I'm not sure. Just something to be aware of.
* <a href="#21:17.29" id="21:17.29">21:17.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Understood.
