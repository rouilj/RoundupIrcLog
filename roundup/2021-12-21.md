* <a href="#01:36.36" id="01:36.36">01:36.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] are you still buried in log4j issues or did you have a chance to look into a setuptools equivalent for: from distutils.command.build import build
* <a href="#02:12.40" id="02:12.40">02:12.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: here's a fun one. Python2's cgi.py calls readline with a max char read size. readline(a<<16). howevr under wsgi it looks like the wsgi.input readline doesn't support the max number of chars to read and it crashes.....
* <a href="#02:13.15" id="02:13.15">02:13.15 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: any pythonista's that can explain why this happens and a way around it?
* <a href="#02:14.33" id="02:14.33">02:14.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] fyi this is in the test suite running your wsgi_liveserver implementation. Not sure if that's contributing.
* <a href="#02:19.42" id="02:19.42">02:19.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nevermind. Apprently it's caused by wsgiref/validate.py the readline defined by the InputWrapper class doesn;t support the extra param. The 3.6 version does. So one item down.
