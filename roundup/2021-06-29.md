# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-29
* <a href="#01:56.39" id="01:56.39">01:56.39 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: go for it
* <a href="#01:57.10" id="01:57.10">01:57.10 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: btw we did our live migration over the weekend/last night, it seems to have gone well so far (I still need to sort out bits and pieces of the email integration)
* <a href="#12:11.51" id="12:11.51">12:11.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, great news. Was Pooh happy too? Just to clarify this was a python2 - roundup 1.4 something on postgres to python3 - roundup 2.0.0 on sqlite?
* <a href="#12:12.51" id="12:12.51">12:12.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: would you be interested in writing up your migration story? A few pargraphs on where the pain points were, size of install etc?
* <a href="#13:36.01" id="13:36.01">13:36.01 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: python2 - roundup 1.4.15 - postgres to python2 - roundup 2.0.0 - sqlite
* <a href="#13:37.50" id="13:37.50">13:37.50 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: sure, I can write something
* <a href="#14:17.39" id="14:17.39">14:17.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, ah ok. Do you have plans on going to python3?
* <a href="#16:37.22" id="16:37.22">16:37.22 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: in theory, but I'm not sure how much time I'll have soon now that the immediate panic is over (we really needed to migrate because it was hosted on an ancient and highly vulnerable OS)
* <a href="#16:37.40" id="16:37.40">16:37.40 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: also we're using mod_python which I see is deprecated, so the first step would be to move off that
* <a href="#16:37.49" id="16:37.49">16:37.49 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: especially since it seems to be tied to python2 itself
* <a href="#16:39.53" id="16:39.53">16:39.53 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: one of the final things I discovered was that we had a local patch to 1.4.15 to support a "blacklist" for outgoing email - one of us had submitted it as a patch years ago (<https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman/message/25949186>/) but I don't think it went any further
* <a href="#16:40.12" id="16:40.12">16:40.12 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: so that caused a bit of hassle migrating our detectors (I just disabled using that feature for now)
