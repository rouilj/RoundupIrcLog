# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-29
* <a href="#01:56.39" id="01:56.39">01:56.39 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: go for it
* <a href="#01:57.10" id="01:57.10">01:57.10 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: btw we did our live migration over the weekend/last night, it seems to have gone well so far (I still need to sort out bits and pieces of the email integration)
* <a href="#12:11.51" id="12:11.51">12:11.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, great news. Was Pooh happy too? Just to clarify this was a python2 - roundup 1.4 something on postgres to python3 - roundup 2.0.0 on sqlite?
* <a href="#12:12.51" id="12:12.51">12:12.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: would you be interested in writing up your migration story? A few pargraphs on where the pain points were, size of install etc?
* <a href="#13:36.01" id="13:36.01">13:36.01 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: python2 - roundup 1.4.15 - postgres to python2 - roundup 2.0.0 - sqlite
* <a href="#13:37.50" id="13:37.50">13:37.50 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: sure, I can write something
* <a href="#14:17.39" id="14:17.39">14:17.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, ah ok. Do you have plans on going to python3?
* <a href="#16:37.22" id="16:37.22">16:37.22 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: in theory, but I'm not sure how much time I'll have soon now that the immediate panic is over (we really needed to migrate because it was hosted on an ancient and highly vulnerable OS)
* <a href="#16:37.40" id="16:37.40">16:37.40 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: also we're using mod_python which I see is deprecated, so the first step would be to move off that
* <a href="#16:37.49" id="16:37.49">16:37.49 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: especially since it seems to be tied to python2 itself
* <a href="#16:39.53" id="16:39.53">16:39.53 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: one of the final things I discovered was that we had a local patch to 1.4.15 to support a "blacklist" for outgoing email - one of us had submitted it as a patch years ago (<https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman/message/25949186>/) but I don't think it went any further
* <a href="#16:40.12" id="16:40.12">16:40.12 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: so that caused a bit of hassle migrating our detectors (I just disabled using that feature for now)
* <a href="#18:06.14" id="18:06.14">18:06.14 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ah that should have been added to the tracker. I would implement it as a local change though. You should be able to override good_recipient using interfaces.py. In it check to see if userid
* <a href="#18:08.42" id="18:08.42">18:08.42 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: in blacklist. If so return false. If not return good_recipient(userid). See: <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/TestPasswordComplexity> where setPassword is intercepted.
* <a href="#18:12.10" id="18:12.10">18:12.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also see: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/customizing.html#interfaces-py-hooking-into-the-core-of-roundup>
* <a href="#18:13.32" id="18:13.32">18:13.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also see: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/customizing.html#stop-nosy-messages-going-to-people-on-vacation>  Heffalump, your blacklist is a permanent vacation 8-).
* <a href="#18:14.39" id="18:14.39">18:14.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The vacation example assumes that the address is associated with a user. If it's a generic address (like external mailing list etc.) then intercepting is the way to go.
* <a href="#18:31.08" id="18:31.08">18:31.08 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I think it's actually driven by the vacation flag in the users file anyway, so perhaps I just need to use that feature properly...
* <a href="#18:33.42" id="18:33.42">18:33.42 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: ok, so the suggested change is basically inlining/simplifying nosymessage from roundupdb.py and then adding the filtering?
