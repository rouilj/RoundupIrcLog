# Roundup IRC Log for 2025-01-30
* <a href="#09:31.16" id="09:31.16">09:31.16 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: crud, that sucks man. good luck :(

* <a href="#09:32.18" id="09:32.18">09:32.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: thanks for getting back to me, dudes. when i run "os import" then "os.stat" it returns "<built-in function stat>"

* <a href="#09:33.58" id="09:33.58">09:33.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat'" error does not come with an associated line number

* <a href="#09:35.31" id="09:35.31">09:35.31 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: and as for backends, are you guys recommending sqlite at this point over anydm or a dedicated db? i don't think we really need a dedicated db. i believe there're like 10-20 users using this. and they aren't hammering it constantly or anything like that

* <a href="#09:52.21" id="09:52.21">09:52.21 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: randy_: I should have said os.path.stat.  And a pastebin of whatever traceback you are getting would be the most useful thing, I think.

* <a href="#09:55.35" id="09:55.35">09:55.35 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I have a feeling this is a roundup bug, that it is using path vi os.path, but os.path.stat existing was an accident of implementation.  But that's just a theory until we know what line of code is triggering the error.

* <a href="#09:56.22" id="09:56.22">09:56.22 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: As for db, I'm a python dev more than a roundup dev and am currently using very old version of roundup, so I can't help you with current best practice, I'm afraid.

* <a href="#09:57.32" id="09:57.32">09:57.32 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: do you think it'd be worth going back a python3 version and trying again?
* <a href="#09:58.02" id="09:58.02">09:58.02 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: or perhaps trying it on a linux box instead of a windows box?

* <a href="#09:59.12" id="09:59.12">09:59.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ntpath sounds like a windows thing. could be wrong. i'm not too well versed in python outside of running it.

* <a href="#09:59.48" id="09:59.48">09:59.48 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Well, os.ntpath.stat exists in 3.12, so I expect if you run it under that version of python you will avoid the problem. We still want to fix the roundup bug, though... ;)
* <a href="#10:00.01" id="10:00.01">10:00.01 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: And yes, it is a windows thing, which makes it harder for me to test ;)
