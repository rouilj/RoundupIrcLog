# Roundup IRC Log for 2025-01-30
* <a href="#09:31.16" id="09:31.16">09:31.16 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: crud, that sucks man. good luck :(

* <a href="#09:32.18" id="09:32.18">09:32.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: thanks for getting back to me, dudes. when i run "os import" then "os.stat" it returns "<built-in function stat>"

* <a href="#09:33.58" id="09:33.58">09:33.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat'" error does not come with an associated line number

* <a href="#09:35.31" id="09:35.31">09:35.31 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: and as for backends, are you guys recommending sqlite at this point over anydm or a dedicated db? i don't think we really need a dedicated db. i believe there're like 10-20 users using this. and they aren't hammering it constantly or anything like that

* <a href="#09:52.21" id="09:52.21">09:52.21 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: randy_: I should have said os.path.stat.  And a pastebin of whatever traceback you are getting would be the most useful thing, I think.

* <a href="#09:55.35" id="09:55.35">09:55.35 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I have a feeling this is a roundup bug, that it is using path vi os.path, but os.path.stat existing was an accident of implementation.  But that's just a theory until we know what line of code is triggering the error.

* <a href="#09:56.22" id="09:56.22">09:56.22 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: As for db, I'm a python dev more than a roundup dev and am currently using very old version of roundup, so I can't help you with current best practice, I'm afraid.

* <a href="#09:57.32" id="09:57.32">09:57.32 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: do you think it'd be worth going back a python3 version and trying again?
* <a href="#09:58.02" id="09:58.02">09:58.02 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: or perhaps trying it on a linux box instead of a windows box?

* <a href="#09:59.12" id="09:59.12">09:59.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ntpath sounds like a windows thing. could be wrong. i'm not too well versed in python outside of running it.

* <a href="#09:59.48" id="09:59.48">09:59.48 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Well, os.ntpath.stat exists in 3.12, so I expect if you run it under that version of python you will avoid the problem. We still want to fix the roundup bug, though... ;)
* <a href="#10:00.01" id="10:00.01">10:00.01 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: And yes, it is a windows thing, which makes it harder for me to test ;)

* <a href="#10:00.28" id="10:00.28">10:00.28 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: windows stays winning! B-)
* <a href="#10:01.17" id="10:01.17">10:01.17 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: os.path.stat exists on linux, so switching linux with 3.13 would also work.
* <a href="#10:01.23" id="10:01.23">10:01.23 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok cool. i'll try 3.12 on windows. i do want other people to be able to maintain this. we're mostly a windows shop unless an appliance calls for linux

* <a href="#10:01.50" id="10:01.50">10:01.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: thanks man :)

* <a href="#10:03.40" id="10:03.40">10:03.40 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah if i run "os.path.stat" in python 3.13.1 for windows, i get that "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat'" error same as when i tried to run roundup-server

* <a href="#10:05.02" id="10:05.02">10:05.02 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Now, if only you could help me fix the fact that my windows 10 system is refusing to boot to the desktop after the most recent update :) :)

* <a href="#10:06.58" id="10:06.58">10:06.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: lol did you guys both get nukjed
* <a href="#10:07.00" id="10:07.00">10:07.00 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: nuked
* <a href="#10:07.18" id="10:07.18">10:07.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah maybe. can you boot into safe mode and uninstall the last bath of updates?

* <a href="#10:07.46" id="10:07.46">10:07.46 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: No idea.  I'm hoping Microsoft isn't that cruel.  It did this once before and after several reboots it works, so I'm not going to try safe mode just yet.
* <a href="#10:08.21" id="10:08.21">10:08.21 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: if you search "uninstall updates" in your start menu it should show you the menu you need to roll back recent updates
* <a href="#10:08.36" id="10:08.36">10:08.36 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: which should work how you'd think it'd work
* <a href="#10:08.46" id="10:08.46">10:08.46 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I can't even get as far as the search box so far.  This is kind of off topic for this channel, though.

* <a href="#10:08.58" id="10:08.58">10:08.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh crud
* <a href="#10:09.04" id="10:09.04">10:09.04 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Ah, this reboot worked.
* <a href="#10:09.15" id="10:09.15">10:09.15 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh crud! B-)
* <a href="#10:09.41" id="10:09.41">10:09.41 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Yeah, gotta love Windows reliability ;)

* <a href="#10:10.11" id="10:10.11">10:10.11 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: it's the best for a reason! â„¢

* <a href="#14:18.24" id="14:18.24">14:18.24 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: Hi randy, it's rouilj.
