# Roundup IRC Log for 2025-01-30
* <a href="#09:31.16" id="09:31.16">09:31.16 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: crud, that sucks man. good luck :(

* <a href="#09:32.18" id="09:32.18">09:32.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: thanks for getting back to me, dudes. when i run "os import" then "os.stat" it returns "<built-in function stat>"

* <a href="#09:33.58" id="09:33.58">09:33.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat'" error does not come with an associated line number

* <a href="#09:35.31" id="09:35.31">09:35.31 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: and as for backends, are you guys recommending sqlite at this point over anydm or a dedicated db? i don't think we really need a dedicated db. i believe there're like 10-20 users using this. and they aren't hammering it constantly or anything like that

* <a href="#09:52.21" id="09:52.21">09:52.21 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: randy_: I should have said os.path.stat.  And a pastebin of whatever traceback you are getting would be the most useful thing, I think.

* <a href="#09:55.35" id="09:55.35">09:55.35 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I have a feeling this is a roundup bug, that it is using path vi os.path, but os.path.stat existing was an accident of implementation.  But that's just a theory until we know what line of code is triggering the error.

* <a href="#09:56.22" id="09:56.22">09:56.22 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: As for db, I'm a python dev more than a roundup dev and am currently using very old version of roundup, so I can't help you with current best practice, I'm afraid.

* <a href="#09:57.32" id="09:57.32">09:57.32 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: do you think it'd be worth going back a python3 version and trying again?
* <a href="#09:58.02" id="09:58.02">09:58.02 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: or perhaps trying it on a linux box instead of a windows box?

* <a href="#09:59.12" id="09:59.12">09:59.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ntpath sounds like a windows thing. could be wrong. i'm not too well versed in python outside of running it.

* <a href="#09:59.48" id="09:59.48">09:59.48 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Well, os.ntpath.stat exists in 3.12, so I expect if you run it under that version of python you will avoid the problem. We still want to fix the roundup bug, though... ;)
* <a href="#10:00.01" id="10:00.01">10:00.01 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: And yes, it is a windows thing, which makes it harder for me to test ;)

* <a href="#10:00.28" id="10:00.28">10:00.28 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: windows stays winning! B-)
* <a href="#10:01.17" id="10:01.17">10:01.17 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: os.path.stat exists on linux, so switching linux with 3.13 would also work.
* <a href="#10:01.23" id="10:01.23">10:01.23 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok cool. i'll try 3.12 on windows. i do want other people to be able to maintain this. we're mostly a windows shop unless an appliance calls for linux

* <a href="#10:01.50" id="10:01.50">10:01.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: thanks man :)

* <a href="#10:03.40" id="10:03.40">10:03.40 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah if i run "os.path.stat" in python 3.13.1 for windows, i get that "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat'" error same as when i tried to run roundup-server

* <a href="#10:05.02" id="10:05.02">10:05.02 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Now, if only you could help me fix the fact that my windows 10 system is refusing to boot to the desktop after the most recent update :) :)

* <a href="#10:06.58" id="10:06.58">10:06.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: lol did you guys both get nukjed
* <a href="#10:07.00" id="10:07.00">10:07.00 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: nuked
* <a href="#10:07.18" id="10:07.18">10:07.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah maybe. can you boot into safe mode and uninstall the last bath of updates?

* <a href="#10:07.46" id="10:07.46">10:07.46 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: No idea.  I'm hoping Microsoft isn't that cruel.  It did this once before and after several reboots it works, so I'm not going to try safe mode just yet.
* <a href="#10:08.21" id="10:08.21">10:08.21 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: if you search "uninstall updates" in your start menu it should show you the menu you need to roll back recent updates
* <a href="#10:08.36" id="10:08.36">10:08.36 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: which should work how you'd think it'd work
* <a href="#10:08.46" id="10:08.46">10:08.46 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I can't even get as far as the search box so far.  This is kind of off topic for this channel, though.

* <a href="#10:08.58" id="10:08.58">10:08.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh crud
* <a href="#10:09.04" id="10:09.04">10:09.04 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Ah, this reboot worked.
* <a href="#10:09.15" id="10:09.15">10:09.15 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh crud! B-)
* <a href="#10:09.41" id="10:09.41">10:09.41 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Yeah, gotta love Windows reliability ;)

* <a href="#10:10.11" id="10:10.11">10:10.11 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: it's the best for a reason! â„¢

* <a href="#14:18.24" id="14:18.24">14:18.24 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: Hi randy, it's rouilj.

* <a href="#14:19.32" id="14:19.32">14:19.32 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: DB selection depends more on how many issues you will have as well as number of users, also different backends support different full text search options.

* <a href="#14:20.25" id="14:20.25">14:20.25 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: For a small setup, yes sqlite should do well. I don't have any capacity numbers though. Maybe try emailing the roundup-users mailing list to see if anybody can pull some examples from their trackers.

* <a href="#14:21.32" id="14:21.32">14:21.32 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: Sadly one of the biggest proponents of roundup had more than 10 trackers (17 I think) but he retired from his school and I can't see if any of their people are on the mailing list.

* <a href="#14:24.39" id="14:24.39">14:24.39 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: I was hoping to get you to python3'ize the sql server backend. But if you don't have a DBA on staff who manages/backs up sql server for you then sqlite with backups would be a good choice.

* <a href="#14:26.19" id="14:26.19">14:26.19 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: On windows you might need to run the sqlite3 command to export/backup the sqlite database. Copying the db file itself may work, but I am not sure how windows will react if it's copied during a transaction.
* <a href="#14:26.28" id="14:26.28">14:26.28 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: Locking differs between windows and linux.

* <a href="#14:31.05" id="14:31.05">14:31.05 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: also sqlite over anydbm yes. Especially on windows. Windows has a particularly horrible dumbdbm implementation.

* <a href="#14:33.24" id="14:33.24">14:33.24 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: With 3.13 anydbm is implemented using sqlite. <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551367> - I have CI running a 3.13 release, but I am not sure if the sqlite anydbm is being used.

* <a href="#14:42.00" id="14:42.00">14:42.00 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok, we'd only be using one tracker.

* <a href="#14:42.54" id="14:42.54">14:42.54 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: also issue tracker server runs fine in python 3.12.8 on windows

* <a href="#14:43.48" id="14:43.48">14:43.48 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: it was not in the latest 3.13.1

* <a href="#14:44.45" id="14:44.45">14:44.45 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: I assume this line is the problem:  roundup/cgi/engine_zopetal.py:33:            stime = os.stat(src)[os.path.stat.ST_MTIME]

* <a href="#14:45.26" id="14:45.26">14:45.26 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: that's the only path.stat reference I can find. I am trying to figure out if that is correct and when it's called.
* <a href="#14:46.19" id="14:46.19">14:46.19 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: is there a way to export the data from the old install that's using mssqlserver via the application? and then import the data to the new install that's using sqlite via the application? or would i be stuck grabbing the data from the db itself and trying to re-import?

* <a href="#14:46.47" id="14:46.47">14:46.47 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i can try to python3-ize my old mssqlserver backend. i'm not doing a million things at once anymore
* <a href="#14:46.59" id="14:46.59">14:46.59 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: os.path.stat (when ie exists) is just a reference to os.stat, so no, that call is not correct and should be fixed to be just os.stat.ST_MTIME.
* <a href="#14:47.17" id="14:47.17">14:47.17 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: yes, kind of. The export/import commands of roundup-admin have had some fixes done to them.

* <a href="#14:47.57" id="14:47.57">14:47.57 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: They are meant for moving between backends (msql -> sqlite) with the same version of roundup.

* <a href="#14:48.42" id="14:48.42">14:48.42 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: They can also export all the files so you can keep two trackers running and export from 1 and import into the other with all the files etc populated by the import.
* <a href="#14:49.26" id="14:49.26">14:49.26 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok. would it be worth trying to jump between versions? i don't mind small glitches or quirks. doesn't need to be perfect.

* <a href="#14:50.52" id="14:50.52">14:50.52 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: You are doing the backend transfer but between two different versions of Roundup. That could work and has in the past (upgrade from 1.5 to 2.1 IIRC).
* <a href="#14:51.14" id="14:51.14">14:51.14 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: That's where one patch for export/import came from.
* <a href="#14:51.25" id="14:51.25">14:51.25 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah i'd want to just try that if you think it'd be worth a shot.

* <a href="#14:52.21" id="14:52.21">14:52.21 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: bitdancer thanks. The alias dissapeared. Does it exist in 3.13 for linux, because that code should be getting tested in CI and it's passing.

* <a href="#14:52.50" id="14:52.50">14:52.50 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Yeah, it exists in the linux path module.
* <a href="#14:53.06" id="14:53.06">14:53.06 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i want to avoid that piece by piece update process from 1.4 or 1.5 to 2.4 if i can help it.
* <a href="#14:53.12" id="14:53.12">14:53.12 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I suspect no one noticed that it changed for windows, and it was a side effect of some other change to ntpath.

* <a href="#14:53.42" id="14:53.42">14:53.42 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: randy_ yes, give it a shot. See: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/man_pages/roundup-admin.1.html> for the man page
* <a href="#14:54.12" id="14:54.12">14:54.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i also don't mind trying to get mssqlserver going for the new instance and try to just do mssqlserver -> mssqlserver
* <a href="#14:54.20" id="14:54.20">14:54.20 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok cool. i'll give it a shot
* <a href="#14:54.31" id="14:54.31">14:54.31 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ty!
* <a href="#14:54.39" id="14:54.39">14:54.39 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: bitdancer, well that explains CI being ok. So does this look like a python windows bug?

* <a href="#14:55.22" id="14:55.22">14:55.22 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: "trying to get mssqlserver"... cool. that would be great.

* <a href="#14:55.54" id="14:55.54">14:55.54 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: > i want to avoid that piece by piece update process from 1.4 or 1.5 to 2.4 if i can help it

* <a href="#14:57.11" id="14:57.11">14:57.11 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: well you are going to need to update the tracker. The best way to debug issues with tracker changes is X -> 1.6.1; python3 all the things 1.6.1->2.0.0 (or 2.4.0) then 2.0.0 or 2.4.0 if you're not there already.

* <a href="#14:58.24" id="14:58.24">14:58.24 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: also randy if you want to run with python 3.13 under windows, can you try the change bitdancer suggested replacing os.path.stat.ST_MTIME with os.stat.ST_MTIME
* <a href="#14:58.30" id="14:58.30">14:58.30 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: and see if that works.

* <a href="#14:59.03" id="14:59.03">14:59.03 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: sorry randy_ that should have been.

* <a href="#15:04.00" id="15:04.00">15:04.00 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: bitdancer with python: 3.8.10 the equivalent in a REPL of 'import os; print(os.stat.path.ST_MTIME); print(os.stat.ST_MTIME);" throws AttributeError: 'builtin_function_or_method' object has no attribute 'ST_MTIME'

* <a href="#15:08.21" id="15:08.21">15:08.21 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: ok, randy_ if you can test, it looks like we need to add "import stat" up top of engine_zopetal.py then change "os.path.stat.ST_MTIME" to stat.ST_MTIME does that look right bitdancer?
* <a href="#15:08.54" id="15:08.54">15:08.54 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc108](https://github.com/qwebirc108)__: welcome Taggnostr

* <a href="#15:09.38" id="15:09.38">15:09.38 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: qwebirc108: oh, right, I got confused between os.stat and the stat module.

* <a href="#15:54.07" id="15:54.07">15:54.07 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah that worked!

* <a href="#15:54.35" id="15:54.35">15:54.35 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i made those two changes to engine_zopetal.py and now it runs under python 3.13.1 for windows
* <a href="#15:54.41" id="15:54.41">15:54.41 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: real slick, thanks
* <a href="#15:55.39" id="15:55.39">15:55.39 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i'm hopping off in a sec. i'll start the update procedure over tomorrow and chip away at it

* <a href="#15:55.46" id="15:55.46">15:55.46 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: thanks again for your help
* <a href="#15:55.47" id="15:55.47">15:55.47 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: night

* <a href="#18:59.02" id="18:59.02">18:59.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: randy_ one more thing occurs to me. Export files were normalized to use line feed line terminators. So your export files may need to be manually normalized replacing carriage return + lf with just lf.
