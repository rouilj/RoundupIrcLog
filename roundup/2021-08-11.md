* <a href="#09:53.49" id="09:53.49">09:53.49 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: You are welcome to mention ours (support.murrayandwalker.com), but it isn't very interesting unless you are one of our customers ;)  (All you see is a login/register screen).
* <a href="#19:16.32" id="19:16.32">19:16.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: bitdancer thanks. Is it used as a customer portal?
* <a href="#19:18.07" id="19:18.07">19:18.07 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if you guys need some roundup consulting, give me a shout. I am unemployed at the moment.
* <a href="#19:20.08" id="19:20.08">19:20.08 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The mention in the article would be something like: "Murray and Walker have been using it for X years as a customer support portal." where I link to your main web site <https://www.murrayandwalker.com>
* <a href="#19:22.27" id="19:22.27">19:22.27 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also which roundup version are you running?
