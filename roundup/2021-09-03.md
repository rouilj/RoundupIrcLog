# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-09-03
* <a href="#02:30.13" id="02:30.13">02:30.13 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: Thank you very much for your valuable input. I will have a look at this later. And yes, you are very correct in your assumption about it is an index iterating over the sa class. I've yet to understand what classes I can expect to be available for me to use within a certain html/view. Many years ago I was doing some web development and im stuck in the way of thinking how objects might relate to
* <a href="#02:30.19" id="02:30.19">02:30.19 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: eachother through pivots or direct sql relations, I don't know whats the case here with hyperdb =)
* <a href="#02:35.13" id="02:35.13">02:35.13 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <td tal:content="python:sa.admincontact.address.plain()"> worked perfectly!
* <a href="#02:50.08" id="02:50.08">02:50.08 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: now all left to do is fixing export as CSV.. seems like that function wants the fields to export to be a part of the query parameters. To output the field in the iteration of the sa class sa.admincontact.address.plain() worked nicely, but unsure howto pass it in the &@columns query paramter?
* <a href="#09:17.49" id="09:17.49">09:17.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, I wonder... Try adding adding admincontact.address to @columns in the URL by editing the URL directly. Then load the modified URL. The display should be unchanged (if it is a normal index page). Then try using the csv export. IIRC search is transitive (that is I can search using admincontact.address and it will work). But that may be in the rest interface only. I'll have to see.
* <a href="#09:24.11" id="09:24.11">09:24.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If search is transitive perhaps the csv columns will work as well.....  If not you can either look to see if admincontact is being output by the csv generator and you can make your own csv generator put out the address as well. See: <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/ExportCSVNames_Extended> also you can use your version to replace the built-in version by changing instance.registerAction('export_csv_names', ExportCSVNamesAction) to
* <a href="#09:24.11" id="09:24.11">09:24.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ce.registerAction('export_csv', ExportCSVNamesAction)
* <a href="#09:45.07" id="09:45.07">09:45.07 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: adding admincontact.address to @columns did not work, "Column "admincontact.address" not found in sa"
* <a href="#11:06.12" id="11:06.12">11:06.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: nomicon I saw you response about admincontact.address in the log. Bummer.
* <a href="#11:18.47" id="11:18.47">11:18.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: hmm, that error is actually the result of a specific check. I'll bet it was due to he code throwing an error on an actual bad column. Yup: <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2550712>
* <a href="#11:22.51" id="11:22.51">11:22.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: looks like it needs to be smarter and use get_transitive_prop() hyperdb method to walk sa.assignedcontact.address and validate it. That plos a small change to handle a missing ey in the props array should do the trick I'll ticket it.
