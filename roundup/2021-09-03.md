And yes, you are very correct in your assumption about it is an index iterating over the sa class. I've yet to understand what classes I can expect to be available for me to use within a certain html/view. Many years ago I was doing some web development and im stuck in the way of thinking how objects might relate to
* <a href="#02:30.19" id="02:30.19">02:30.19 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: eachother through pivots or direct sql relations, I don't know whats the case here with hyperdb =)
* <a href="#02:35.13" id="02:35.13">02:35.13 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <td tal:content="python:sa.admincontact.address.plain()"> worked perfectly!
* <a href="#02:50.08" id="02:50.08">02:50.08 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: now all left to do is fixing export as CSV.. seems like that function wants the fields to export to be a part of the query parameters. To output the field in the iteration of the sa class sa.admincontact.address.plain() worked nicely, but unsure howto pass it in the &@columns query paramter?
