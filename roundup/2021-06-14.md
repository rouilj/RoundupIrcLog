# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-14
* <a href="#03:18.02" id="03:18.02">03:18.02 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: That issue doesn't seem relevant. I am not sure if a source tree from VCS is exactly the same as the distribution I'd get via pip after an official release (I looked through RELEASE.txt and didn't spot anything that was clearly crucial but I didn't actually do any of the steps). I'll drop this for now.
* <a href="#11:42.30" id="11:42.30">11:42.30 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok
* <a href="#11:43.02" id="11:43.02">11:43.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but yes, the pip source distribution should be almost exactly the same as what you have by checking out head.
* <a href="#11:56.41" id="11:56.41">11:56.41 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: fyi I hope to have 2.1.0b1 out this or next week.
* <a href="#12:16.25" id="12:16.25">12:16.25 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I'll try harder to run it once we've got this migration actually done :-)
* <a href="#12:50.29" id="12:50.29">12:50.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ack. I'm afk for the next few hours.
* <a href="#18:15.06" id="18:15.06">18:15.06 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, I realized you don't have the latest setup.py. Can you try this patch: <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/file1764/setup_install_under_prefix_or_slash_usr2.patch>? Part of: <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551143>.
* <a href="#18:15.55" id="18:15.55">18:15.55 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: This does some fixes for install of data files (man pages, templates ...).
* <a href="#18:28.57" id="18:28.57">18:28.57 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: will do (probably not immediately)
* <a href="#20:33.54" id="20:33.54">20:33.54 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Fair enough.
