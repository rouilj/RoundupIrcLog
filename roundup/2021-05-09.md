* <a href="#13:39.49" id="13:39.49">13:39.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr, what are you guys looking for regarding a tool to handle CLA's in <https://github.com/psf/gh-migration/projects/1>? I can see a CLA class in roundup with a CLA text property and a version identifier, a CLAv1 link from user to CLA and a druid to guide CLA agreement and signing.
