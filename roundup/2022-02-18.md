# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-02-18
* <a href="#09:55.45" id="09:55.45">09:55.45 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: It seems my tracker is not handling utf8 in Subject lines, it gets mangled.. where would I start debugging this in roundup ?
* <a href="#10:02.49" id="10:02.49">10:02.49 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: "Förnya" becomes "FÃ¶rnya"
* <a href="#10:59.25" id="10:59.25">10:59.25 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Inbound or outbound?  If inbound, it might be that the sender isn't encoding it properly.
* <a href="#17:46.38" id="17:46.38">17:46.38 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: "FÃ¶rnya" looks like utf-8 displayed as iso-8859-1, but if the other utf-8 messages look fine, it might be a double-encoding issue
