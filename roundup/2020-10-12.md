* <a id="21:40.43">21:40.43 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I wasn't bale to find ny logging services out there so I came up with this hack as a workaround. If anybody has other ideas that would be great. Currently it runs on my home "server" that runs my roundup tracker development server: https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/fossil/roundup_sysadmin/home and the demo instance: https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo/
* <a id="21:41.45">21:41.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if you log in as demo/demo to the instance there is a drag and drop interface that allows temporary reordering of issues. It can lso be recorded in the back end by using the multiedit interface.
