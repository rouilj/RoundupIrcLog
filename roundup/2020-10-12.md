* <a href="#21:38.25" id="21:38.25">21:38.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I push those logs to git under: https://github.com/rouilj/test.git at the moment on a daily basis. You can look at the logs there or clone it if you need to do a grep etc.
* <a href="#21:40.43" id="21:40.43">21:40.43 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I wasn't bale to find ny logging services out there so I came up with this hack as a workaround. If anybody has other ideas that would be great. Currently it runs on my home "server" that runs my roundup tracker development server: https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/fossil/roundup_sysadmin/home and the demo instance: https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo/
* <a href="#21:41.45" id="21:41.45">21:41.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if you log in as demo/demo to the instance there is a drag and drop interface that allows temporary reordering of issues. It can lso be recorded in the back end by using the multiedit interface.
* <a href="#21:48.20" id="21:48.20">21:48.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Roundup Discussion Channel (see https://www.roundup-tracker.org for project info) Current stable release 2.0 (2020-07-13); Temp IRC logs at: https://github.com/rouilj/test
* <a href="#21:49.09" id="21:49.09">21:49.09 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I've been using the Matrix bridge for the last couple of years. It has pretty much done away with the need for `grep`ing through irssi logs :D
* <a href="#21:50.02" id="21:50.02">21:50.02 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: storing logs in a git repository is an interesting idea though
* <a href="#21:50.55" id="21:50.55">21:50.55 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan do you have a link for that?
* <a href="#21:52.03" id="21:52.03">21:52.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Yeah putting it into git gets me markdown -> html formating automtically. Also allows anybody to pull it for searching etc. WE have had some interesting discusions here and they have been lost to the ages.
* <a href="#21:52.44" id="21:52.44">21:52.44 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: https://matrix.org/ is the protocol. There is a bit of info about the IRC bridges at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/wiki/End-user-FAQ
* <a href="#21:53.46" id="21:53.46">21:53.46 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I generally use the Element client (https://element.io/), but I hear the matrix weechat plugins works quite well for those who prefer a console client
* <a href="#21:55.45" id="21:55.45">21:55.45 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: An interesting idea could be to use GitLab Pages to provide a nice javascript based frontend to the logs for easy searching.
* <a href="#22:34.00" id="22:34.00">22:34.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Interesting thought.
