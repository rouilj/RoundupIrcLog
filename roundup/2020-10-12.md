* <a id="21:38.25">21:38.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I push those logs to git under: https://github.com/rouilj/test.git at the moment on a daily basis. You can look at the logs there or clone it if you need to do a grep etc.
* <a id="21:40.43">21:40.43 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I wasn't bale to find ny logging services out there so I came up with this hack as a workaround. If anybody has other ideas that would be great. Currently it runs on my home "server" that runs my roundup tracker development server: https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/fossil/roundup_sysadmin/home and the demo instance: https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo/
* <a id="21:41.45">21:41.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if you log in as demo/demo to the instance there is a drag and drop interface that allows temporary reordering of issues. It can lso be recorded in the back end by using the multiedit interface.

* <a id="21:49.09">21:49.09 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I've been using the Matrix bridge for the last couple of years. It has pretty much done away with the need for `grep`ing through irssi logs :D
