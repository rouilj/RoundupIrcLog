# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-02-20
* <a href="#00:00.21" id="00:00.21">00:00.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The mailing list has a wider audience including a number of people who support foreign languages and the people who did the python2->3 support which uncovered encoding issues with mysql.
* <a href="#00:01.15" id="00:01.15">00:01.15 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So they may have other ideas. When you ask on the mailing list include the version of roundup, python version, database type and version and the encoding/locale used for the database.
* <a href="#00:04.03" id="00:04.03">00:04.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr can you explain your comment? I see one non-ascii character (umlated o) turned into two non-ascii A with a ~ and pilcrow (paragraph) character. Is that something that can happen due to a different character set?
* <a href="#00:14.04" id="00:14.04">00:14.04 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, in iso-8859-1 (aka latin1 ~aka windows1252), a character like ö is represented with one byte, in utf8 it takes 2 bytes instead
* <a href="#00:15.33" id="00:15.33">00:15.33 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: so if you have a utf8 string, that character takes 2 bytes, but if you then display it as latin1, each of the two bytes will correspond to a different character, and you get Ã and ¶ respectively
* <a href="#00:17.48" id="00:17.48">00:17.48 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: however, if you still see Ã¶ and the rest of the page is utf8, it means that it got double-encoded, that is, you started with ö in utf8 (1 character, 2 bytes), it became Ã¶ because it was decoded as latin1 (2 character, 2 bytes), then it got encoded in utf8 again and became became Ã¶ (2 characters, 4 bytes)
* <a href="#00:17.59" id="00:17.59">00:17.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok, that's sort of what I figured. Two bytes being interpreted as a single byte in utf-8 as it can use up to 4 bites IIRC.
* <a href="#00:19.08" id="00:19.08">00:19.08 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> 'Förnya'.encode('utf8')
* <a href="#00:19.08" id="00:19.08">00:19.08 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: b'F\xc3\xb6rnya'
* <a href="#00:19.08" id="00:19.08">00:19.08 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> _.decode('latin1')
* <a href="#00:19.08" id="00:19.08">00:19.08 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 'FÃ¶rnya'
* <a href="#00:19.08" id="00:19.08">00:19.08 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> _.encode('utf8')
* <a href="#00:19.10" id="00:19.10">00:19.10 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: b'F\xc3\x83\xc2\xb6rnya'
* <a href="#00:19.12" id="00:19.12">00:19.12 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> _.decode('utf8')
* <a href="#00:19.14" id="00:19.14">00:19.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 'FÃ¶rnya'
* <a href="#00:19.56" id="00:19.56">00:19.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I know mysql has issues because it's original utf wasn't quite right. utf8mb4 gets it right IIUC.
* <a href="#00:20.42" id="00:20.42">00:20.42 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: if anything at any point decodes a utf8 string as latin1, then this happens
* <a href="#00:20.47" id="00:20.47">00:20.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: gotcha. Not sure how you geterate an umlated o but I see how it transforms.
* <a href="#00:21.16" id="00:21.16">00:21.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think mysql used to use latin1.
* <a href="#00:21.19" id="00:21.19">00:21.19 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: it could be a email client sending a utf8 message, but mistakenly advertise it as latin1
* <a href="#00:22.06" id="00:22.06">00:22.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah yeah. I was assuming web interface generated the data but email is a good point.
* <a href="#00:22.08" id="00:22.08">00:22.08 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: or it could be something sending utf8 but without advertise that it's utf8, and whoever receives falls back on latin1 by default (decoding with latin1 never fails)
* <a href="#00:23.14" id="00:23.14">00:23.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: also note that latin1 is limited to just an extra 128 chars (on top of the 128 ASCII chars), including most european letters with diacritics, but it can't represent anything else
* <a href="#00:23.47" id="00:23.47">00:23.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yup it's an 8 bit range 0-254 right?
* <a href="#00:24.24" id="00:24.24">00:24.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hence the reason utf-8 can go 2^32 rather than just 2^8
* <a href="#00:24.29" id="00:24.29">00:24.29 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yes, all the iso-8859-*/latin*/windows12* are single-byte encoding
* <a href="#00:24.56" id="00:24.56">00:24.56 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: utf-8 is a variable-width multibyte encoding that uses 1 to 4 bytes
* <a href="#00:25.33" id="00:25.33">00:25.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yup hence my "can go" comment. IIRC 0-127 are represented as single bytes in utf-8 encoding.
* <a href="#00:25.38" id="00:25.38">00:25.38 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: right?
* <a href="#00:25.49" id="00:25.49">00:25.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: correct
* <a href="#00:26.05" id="00:26.05">00:26.05 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: both utf8 and latin1 are supersets of ascii
* <a href="#00:26.52" id="00:26.52">00:26.52 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: utf-8 is referred to as an encoding while iso-8859-latin  is a charset? Do I have that terminology right?
* <a href="#00:27.20" id="00:27.20">00:27.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: (Yes I did watch your youtube on this but it was a while ago and I have forgotten most of it. Sorry 8-().
* <a href="#00:28.04" id="00:28.04">00:28.04 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: the definition is a bit fuzzy, because in case of single-byte encoding, you have a 1-to-1 mapping between bytes and characters, so latin 1 can be referred as both a charset and an encoding, whereas utf8 is an encoding
* <a href="#00:28.37" id="00:28.37">00:28.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ah. Ok.   btw how goes the github issues move?
* <a href="#00:29.30" id="00:29.30">00:29.30 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: <https://discuss.python.org/t/github-issues-migration-is-coming-soon/13791>/
* <a href="#00:30.53" id="00:30.53">00:30.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: Łukasz set the deadline to march 11th (he wanted to do march 4th), so I guess I have 3 weeks to figure out everything that is left, unless we postpone :)
* <a href="#00:31.53" id="00:31.53">00:31.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Well good luck. If any of the questions are on the Roundup side, let me know. I may be able to help although I am starting a new job on the 28th.
* <a href="#00:32.18" id="00:32.18">00:32.18 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: one of the things left to do is making bpo read-only
* <a href="#00:32.28" id="00:32.28">00:32.28 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I saw the wiki page, but I'm wondering if that's the best approach
* <a href="#00:33.24" id="00:33.24">00:33.24 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/ReadOnlyTracker>
* <a href="#00:33.38" id="00:33.38">00:33.38 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: a code-only solution would be better, since we can prepare a PR and merge it without having to fiddle with roundup-admin
* <a href="#00:34.01" id="00:34.01">00:34.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: and I think adding the detector should be enough
* <a href="#00:34.25" id="00:34.25">00:34.25 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: we will also remove the edit form and the "create new" button
* <a href="#00:36.00" id="00:36.00">00:36.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well the edit form is the item view form usually.
* <a href="#00:36.39" id="00:36.39">00:36.39 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: on the roundup side we also plan to implement a script that given a bpo issue id redirects to the corresponding GH issue using a bpo->gh mapping.  The same mapping can be used to show a link to the new issue at the top of each issue page and possibly in the issue list
* <a href="#00:36.40" id="00:36.40">00:36.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: edit inputs are generated based on whether the user has edit rights to the class/property.
* <a href="#00:37.23" id="00:37.23">00:37.23 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: couldn't we just change the permissions in the schema, instead of adding a new ReadOnly role to all users with the admin?
* <a href="#00:37.56" id="00:37.56">00:37.56 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: that way we could just remove edit permissions to all current users in the same PR
* <a href="#00:39.09" id="00:39.09">00:39.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well its RBAC right, so you would need to make sure to remove every writable permission from every role. Developer, regular user etc.
* <a href="#00:39.26" id="00:39.26">00:39.26 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: RBAC?
* <a href="#00:39.29" id="00:39.29">00:39.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Certainly doable, but could be tricky.
* <a href="#00:39.39" id="00:39.39">00:39.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: role based access control.
* <a href="#00:39.47" id="00:39.47">00:39.47 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: ok
* <a href="#00:40.07" id="00:40.07">00:40.07 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so the wiki page suggests a new role that is designed to be read only then convert users to that role.
* <a href="#00:40.39" id="00:40.39">00:40.39 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yep, but that can't be assigned to users without running the admin, right?
* <a href="#00:42.22" id="00:42.22">00:42.22 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I'm thinking about a PR that includes 1) detector that prevents edits to issues and creation of new issues; 2) schema changes that remove edit permission from all roles (except maybe coordinators/admins); 3) template changes that remove all forms/button to edit/create issues
* <a href="#00:42.50" id="00:42.50">00:42.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: roundup-admin is the easiest way to reset roles. It could be done manually by editing each user's roles manually.
* <a href="#00:43.45" id="00:43.45">00:43.45 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: with a PR I can deploy it with a click (on the merge button), and also roll it back easily if we need to abort the migration for whatever reason
* <a href="#00:44.04" id="00:44.04">00:44.04 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "remove edit permission from all roles (except maybe coordinators/admins);" that's the tricky part. I'll bet the coordinators/admins only have a few writable permissions assigned to the roles.
* <a href="#00:44.24" id="00:44.24">00:44.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: They probably get edit rights via the User or some other role.
* <a href="#00:45.15" id="00:45.15">00:45.15 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: so you are saying that it's not enough to grep for "edit" in schema.py?
* <a href="#00:45.32" id="00:45.32">00:45.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I haven't looked at your schema and the permissions setup.
* <a href="#00:46.01" id="00:46.01">00:46.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: <https://github.com/psf/bpo-tracker-cpython/blob/master/schema.py>
* <a href="#00:46.40" id="00:46.40">00:46.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 'remove edit permission from all roles (except maybe coordinators/admins);' probably not if you want some users to keep edit rights as their edit rights may not be associated with the coordinator or admin roles.
* <a href="#00:47.29" id="00:47.29">00:47.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: note that the wiki page refers to user id 1. That is special. There is actually code that checks for id 1 (as it's a required id) to make sure that the user with id 1 isn't locked out of the core
* <a href="#00:47.31" id="00:47.31">00:47.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: roundup.
* <a href="#00:48.13" id="00:48.13">00:48.13 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: that's fine, I think the important thing is to block regular users and developers
* <a href="#00:48.43" id="00:48.43">00:48.43 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: coordinators and the admin should be aware of that migration and that bpo is read only, and it's just a few people anyway
* <a href="#00:49.11" id="00:49.11">00:49.11 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: for example removing 287 should prevent users from commenting and attaching files
* <a href="#00:49.43" id="00:49.43">00:49.43 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: removing 322 will prevent them from editing issues
* <a href="#00:50.43" id="00:50.43">00:50.43 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: it's something I'll have to test anyway locally, but it seems doable just by removing those permissions
* <a href="#00:51.51" id="00:51.51">00:51.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you would also have to remove 331 to prevent them from being able to change status/resolution on their own tickets.
* <a href="#00:52.06" id="00:52.06">00:52.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well actually the prevention of change is done by the detector.
* <a href="#00:52.20" id="00:52.20">00:52.20 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yep, and probably a few other permissions too
* <a href="#00:52.49" id="00:52.49">00:52.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: with the 3 things I listed above (schema changes, detector, template changes) we should be pretty safe
* <a href="#00:53.07" id="00:53.07">00:53.07 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: removing the lines you identified will prevent seeing edit/input widgets when viewing and issue.
* <a href="#00:54.00" id="00:54.00">00:54.00 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: indeed, I could leave them in the template or just hardcode them out to be extra safe
* <a href="#00:54.12" id="00:54.12">00:54.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah. If they try to change keywords, user etc. those can just be rejected as there isn;t a lot they can change.
* <a href="#00:54.41" id="00:54.41">00:54.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah changing field or .field to plain() or .plain should work.
* <a href="#00:55.59" id="00:55.59">00:55.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: another possibility is to prevent logins at all. Only allow people to use the web interface via the anonymous role.
* <a href="#00:56.42" id="00:56.42">00:56.42 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yep, even though they could still access through xmlrpc or rest api
* <a href="#00:57.18" id="00:57.18">00:57.18 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: so the template changes are more about making it clear to people that land on bpo that the tracker is now read-only and they can't/shouldn't change things
* <a href="#00:57.19" id="00:57.19">00:57.19 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also you need to do something about email. The detector should stop changes, but won't be nice. Probably have to put an autoresponder on the email address. I realized I didn't cover that on the wiki page.
* <a href="#00:57.29" id="00:57.29">00:57.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well you don;t have a rest api.
* <a href="#00:57.47" id="00:57.47">00:57.47 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: true, and you are right about the email
* <a href="#00:57.54" id="00:57.54">00:57.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don;t rember if there needs to be an XMLRPC Access permission with 1.6.1
* <a href="#00:58.49" id="00:58.49">00:58.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: xmlrpc uses the same permissions as the web interface, doesn't it?  unless you are just accessing things that anonymous users can see, then you need to log in with your username
* <a href="#00:59.02" id="00:59.02">00:59.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the "Xmlrpc Access" role wasn;t until 2.0
* <a href="#01:01.33" id="01:01.33">01:01.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: what you say about xmlrpc in 1.6.1 is correct. Again the detector should stop changes. If you want some Roles to have the ability to change things you will have to change the detector to allow that.
* <a href="#01:03.01" id="01:03.01">01:03.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Adding a check with: db.user.has_role(db.getuid(),"Coordinator") should work.
* <a href="#01:08.54" id="01:08.54">01:08.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I'm heading to bed.
* <a href="#01:09.01" id="01:09.01">01:09.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: night.
* <a href="#01:10.01" id="01:10.01">01:10.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: good night, thanks for the chat!
* <a href="#01:11.14" id="01:11.14">01:11.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: np.
