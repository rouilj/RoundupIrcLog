# Roundup IRC Log for 2023-10-24
* <a href="#11:04.08" id="11:04.08">11:04.08 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Anyone running Roundup on a SELinux enabled system?

* <a href="#11:05.32" id="11:05.32">11:05.32 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I'm utilizing Procmail as an interface between roundup-mailgw and my smtpd, on an SELinux enabled system. I've gotten it to work with alot of hacking and slashing around with setsebool and audit2allow. It does not give you that warn fuzzy feeling of being production stable, but it works. I'd like to know if anything actually has a proper SELinux policy module for this?
* <a href="#11:05.58" id="11:05.58">11:05.58 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: my long term goal is to have all this setup in Ansible, at the moment it's a complete mess of .txt files and documentation spread out everywhere
