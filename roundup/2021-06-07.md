# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-07
* <a href="#01:02.23" id="01:02.23">01:02.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: heffalump, <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman/roundup-devel/?viewmonth=202106> emails are flowing again.
* <a href="#01:40.56" id="01:40.56">01:40.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: thanks, I see your last email directly too. Out of interest, why can't the import just put the id in directly when "is retired" is True in the CSV?
* <a href="#07:49.47" id="07:49.47">07:49.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I tried to code that by adding __retired__ to the list of properties for the node passed to addnode for creation. It didn't do anything. The retired status is metadata about a node rather than data in the node. So addnode creates the node, the database automatically creates the index entry with the default value of 0 for the __retired__ property. It might be possible to recode addnode to do also set __retired__ in the same transac
* <a href="#07:49.47" id="07:49.47">07:49.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but that would be pretty invasive. The anydbm backend doesn't have this issue. It exists only on rdbms backends because the database has the logic to do unique indices. anydbm implements the unique mechanism in python code rather than defer to the database. So I think it updates the metadata in a single pass.
* <a href="#07:50.45" id="07:50.45">07:50.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: At least that's my guess as I have an automated test that fails on sqlite (and I hope other rdbms's I can only test sqlite at home), but passes on anydbm.
* <a href="#08:08.52" id="08:08.52">08:08.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I see, thanks.
* <a href="#10:11.36" id="10:11.36">10:11.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: heffalump, the current head release has fixes to prevent generating a misordered export. It also adds exception handling on import for that case. The exception handling works to import a misordered export in the automated tests.
