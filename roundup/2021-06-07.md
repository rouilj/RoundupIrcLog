# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-07
* <a href="#01:02.23" id="01:02.23">01:02.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: heffalump, <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman/roundup-devel/?viewmonth=202106> emails are flowing again.
* <a href="#01:40.56" id="01:40.56">01:40.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: thanks, I see your last email directly too. Out of interest, why can't the import just put the id in directly when "is retired" is True in the CSV?
* <a href="#07:49.47" id="07:49.47">07:49.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I tried to code that by adding __retired__ to the list of properties for the node passed to addnode for creation. It didn't do anything. The retired status is metadata about a node rather than data in the node. So addnode creates the node, the database automatically creates the index entry with the default value of 0 for the __retired__ property. It might be possible to recode addnode to do also set __retired__ in the same transac
* <a href="#07:49.47" id="07:49.47">07:49.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but that would be pretty invasive. The anydbm backend doesn't have this issue. It exists only on rdbms backends because the database has the logic to do unique indices. anydbm implements the unique mechanism in python code rather than defer to the database. So I think it updates the metadata in a single pass.
* <a href="#07:50.45" id="07:50.45">07:50.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: At least that's my guess as I have an automated test that fails on sqlite (and I hope other rdbms's I can only test sqlite at home), but passes on anydbm.
* <a href="#08:08.52" id="08:08.52">08:08.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I see, thanks.
* <a href="#10:11.36" id="10:11.36">10:11.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: heffalump, the current head release has fixes to prevent generating a misordered export. It also adds exception handling on import for that case. The exception handling works to import a misordered export in the automated tests.
* <a href="#10:12.19" id="10:12.19">10:12.19 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also it logs along with the rest of the database logs when it triggers the exception fixup.
* <a href="#10:52.40" id="10:52.40">10:52.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: heffalump, just to be sure. When you used an unedited export from 1.4.15 and tried to import it into postgres you got the unique constraint failure as well. Am I correct?
* <a href="#12:18.58" id="12:18.58">12:18.58 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I never tried with importing into postgres. It was on the list to try if I hadn't figure this out but I never go that far, as it would have required actually setting up postgres which I don't want to do - hence shifting to the sqlite backend.
* <a href="#12:19.46" id="12:19.46">12:19.46 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I'll give the head release a go (though I never figured out where the logs go so I won't be able to check that - though I suppose I should sort that out anyway so I can look at logs when I have this in production)
* <a href="#12:33.09" id="12:33.09">12:33.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I ask because: 'exception handling works to import a misordered export in the automated tests.' doesn't trigger the fixup for postgres and mysql currently.
* <a href="#12:34.58" id="12:34.58">12:34.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok, so postgres isn't working but we don't know if it did before. Fair enough. Yeah getting logging working would be a win. I think if your logger has a syntax error, it will fail to start roundup.
* <a href="#12:35.59" id="12:35.59">12:35.59 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so you could try messing up a section header [header rather than [header] and see if it fails. If so you know you have logger.ini correctly configured in config.ini.
* <a href="#12:36.00" id="12:36.00">12:36.00 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: and just to be sure, you think that roundup-admin should log just like running roundup itself logs?
* <a href="#12:36.03" id="12:36.03">12:36.03 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: ok
* <a href="#12:36.29" id="12:36.29">12:36.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yes, roundup-admin should log given a proper logging config.
* <a href="#23:08.49" id="23:08.49">23:08.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr are you around?
