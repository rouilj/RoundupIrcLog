# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-01-04
* <a href="#02:05.20" id="02:05.20">02:05.20 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: thanks for the pointer about strace and manually.
* <a href="#02:06.10" id="02:06.10">02:06.10 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I would agree that its probably 'process file size limit' aswell. Only file in my TRACKER_HOME/log/ directory  is roundup.log, and if I truncate that file everything is fine
* <a href="#04:11.27" id="04:11.27">04:11.27 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: does the files in db/files/ need any conversions when upgrading roundup? Im moving from 1.4.20 to 2.x. Right now im just doing exporttables / importtables
* <a href="#04:11.45" id="04:11.45">04:11.45 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: would it be safe to just rsync this folder to the new instance?
