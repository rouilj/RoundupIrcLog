* <a href="#02:05.20" id="02:05.20">02:05.20 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: thanks for the pointer about strace and manually.
* <a href="#02:06.10" id="02:06.10">02:06.10 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I would agree that its probably 'process file size limit' aswell. Only file in my TRACKER_HOME/log/ directory  is roundup.log, and if I truncate that file everything is fine
* <a href="#04:11.27" id="04:11.27">04:11.27 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: does the files in db/files/ need any conversions when upgrading roundup? Im moving from 1.4.20 to 2.x. Right now im just doing exporttables / importtables
* <a href="#04:11.45" id="04:11.45">04:11.45 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: would it be safe to just rsync this folder to the new instance?
* <a href="#07:29.58" id="07:29.58">07:29.58 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: how is the integer value of the primary key incremented/calculcated? I just got
* <a href="#07:30.01" id="07:30.01">07:30.01 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: psycopg2.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "_msg_pkey"
* <a href="#07:30.04" id="07:30.04">07:30.04 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: DETAIL:  Key (id)=(59805) already exists.
* <a href="#07:31.01" id="07:31.01">07:31.01 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: when I mailed a new issue to my test tracker. Im just trying to figure out how I ended up in this situationen now. I've been hacking & slashing on this test instance tracker for quite a while now. every now and then I import the db from my production tracker, but I sometime forget to also update the db/files/ contents
* <a href="#14:14.26" id="14:14.26">14:14.26 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I am having trouble logging in with a new initialised instance. When I try using the admin password I don't get any error messages, just get redirected to the main page again
* <a href="#14:14.38" id="14:14.38">14:14.38 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: Anyone know why that might be? I'm using the docker container
* <a href="#14:17.59" id="14:17.59">14:17.59 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I'm also using the responsive template if that matters?
* <a href="#14:20.29" id="14:20.29">14:20.29 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: can you see any logs in the docker container?
* <a href="#14:21.51" id="14:21.51">14:21.51 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: 172.17.0.1 - - [04/Jan/2022 19:21:32] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 302 - 172.17.0.1 - - [04/Jan/2022 13:21:32] "GET /issues/index HTTP/1.1" 200 -
* <a href="#14:21.57" id="14:21.57">14:21.57 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: Just normal requests coming through
* <a href="#14:22.45" id="14:22.45">14:22.45 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: and in the left sidebar do you still see the login form, or something like "Hello, admin"?
* <a href="#14:23.18" id="14:23.18">14:23.18 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: It's still the login form
* <a href="#14:23.31" id="14:23.31">14:23.31 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: the username should be "admin" when I login right? That's what it looks like from the sqlite db
* <a href="#14:24.45" id="14:24.45">14:24.45 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I'm not familiar with the setup of the docker container, but admin and anonymous are two special users that are created by default
* <a href="#14:25.14" id="14:25.14">14:25.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: generally you would create a new user and use that, not sure if the docker container does that for you already
* <a href="#14:26.01" id="14:26.01">14:26.01 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: Yeah I went through the prompts in roundup-admin initialise and set the password through there
* <a href="#14:26.52" id="14:26.52">14:26.52 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I would at least expect an error message for incorrect logins
* <a href="#14:26.54" id="14:26.54">14:26.54 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I don't even get that
* <a href="#14:28.05" id="14:28.05">14:28.05 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: The response is always a 302 for every login post request
* <a href="#14:28.24" id="14:28.24">14:28.24 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: even with random users/passwords?
* <a href="#14:28.29" id="14:28.29">14:28.29 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: yeah
* <a href="#14:29.15" id="14:29.15">14:29.15 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: that seems weird, naybe the docker container is set up to do something different
* <a href="#14:29.34" id="14:29.34">14:29.34 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I was actually getting 400 errors running with the master branch and then got 302s after using latest pypi version
* <a href="#14:30.05" id="14:30.05">14:30.05 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: well I guess I'll poke around some more
* <a href="#14:30.18" id="14:30.18">14:30.18 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj can probably help, but he seems afk now
* <a href="#14:31.26" id="14:31.26">14:31.26 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there should also be a demo include if you want to try that
* <a href="#14:32.29" id="14:32.29">14:32.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: make sure that your web = setting in the config file ends in /.
* <a href="#14:32.47" id="14:32.47">14:32.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alxjsn see above
* <a href="#14:33.37" id="14:33.37">14:33.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alxjsn_ :  make sure that your web = setting in the config file ends in /
* <a href="#14:34.02" id="14:34.02">14:34.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it should have failed to start if it was missing the trailing /, but....
* <a href="#14:35.29" id="14:35.29">14:35.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, that may have been your 400 error. The docker config is a work in progress, so there may be some unseen issues. I did the best I could with docs, but I have been using roundup since 2001 so not a novice user.
* <a href="#14:35.49" id="14:35.49">14:35.49 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: currently using <http://localhost:9017>/
* <a href="#14:36.38" id="14:36.38">14:36.38 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and your docker is binding port 8080 to port 9017
* <a href="#14:37.01" id="14:37.01">14:37.01 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: yeah
* <a href="#14:38.19" id="14:38.19">14:38.19 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: has it worked for your with the responsive template?
* <a href="#14:38.24" id="14:38.24">14:38.24 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: for you*
* <a href="#14:38.26" id="14:38.26">14:38.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, at this point I would pull up the developer tools and see what cookies are returned.
* <a href="#14:38.54" id="14:38.54">14:38.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I usually use the classic template, but I expect the responsive template to work.
* <a href="#14:41.47" id="14:41.47">14:41.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I just started a roundup instance using the responsive template and was able to log in ok.
* <a href="#14:42.18" id="14:42.18">14:42.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you try to log in with the user foo and password foo, you should see an "Invalid user" error message.
* <a href="#14:44.00" id="14:44.00">14:44.00 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: don't see an error message
* <a href="#14:44.05" id="14:44.05">14:44.05 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: same behavior with classic
* <a href="#14:44.42" id="14:44.42">14:44.42 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: are you running this with the master branch?
* <a href="#14:45.14" id="14:45.14">14:45.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you. Running it not with docker, just used demo.py in the top level roundup directory.
* <a href="#14:46.53" id="14:46.53">14:46.53 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Good evening everyone! Hope you had good holidays and a really great new years eve. I was wondering how the id's for issues, msg etc are incremented? Is it handled directly in the db or does it happen in code?
* <a href="#14:47.40" id="14:47.40">14:47.40 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: so demo.py works for me, but doesn't work as a docker container
* <a href="#14:47.41" id="14:47.41">14:47.41 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I got a "   duplicate key value violates unique constraint "_msg_pkey"   " and trying to figure out how I ended up in that situation
* <a href="#14:48.31" id="14:48.31">14:48.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, /issues/index isn't a url I would expect to see.
* <a href="#14:49.18" id="14:49.18">14:49.18 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: My guess is that its not handled by the database, instead its read somewhere of the filesystem, since that id it was trying to insert in my db already existed, so somewhow I got out of sync
* <a href="#14:50.47" id="14:50.47">14:50.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alxjsn ack. I don't know where the 302 to /issues/index is coming from. It should redirect to / as you have no issues path.
* <a href="#14:52.02" id="14:52.02">14:52.02 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: alxjsn: anything infront of the container trying to do pretty urls w/ 302 redirects?
* <a href="#14:53.02" id="14:53.02">14:53.02 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, I'm pretty sure I've seen /issue/index while running it locally
* <a href="#14:53.08" id="14:53.08">14:53.08 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: right now no, requests are going straight to the container
* <a href="#14:53.24" id="14:53.24">14:53.24 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I'm trying a fresh clone and rebuild of the container
* <a href="#14:55.48" id="14:55.48">14:55.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, I am not sure. I would expect /issue if you were running it behind a proxy which mapped / on the roundup-server to /issue on the front end proxy. I have no idea what 'index' would be. I don't find an index class in the schema for the responsive template.
* <a href="#14:56.00" id="14:56.00">14:56.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alxjsn ack.
* <a href="#14:56.17" id="14:56.17">14:56.17 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, did you do a dump/restore of your database?
* <a href="#14:56.51" id="14:56.51">14:56.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: where the id comes from depends on the backend which one are you using?
* <a href="#14:58.18" id="14:58.18">14:58.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also nomicon what were you doing when you got the error?
* <a href="#14:58.19" id="14:58.19">14:58.19 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: postgres. Yes this error was on my test instance. I've done dump of production instance and import on this test instance a couple of times a week
* <a href="#14:58.29" id="14:58.29">14:58.29 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I was just emailing an issue to the tracker
* <a href="#14:58.40" id="14:58.40">14:58.40 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, I just checked with the docker-bpo container that we are using (<https://github.com/python/docker-bpo>), and going to localhost:9999 opens up <http://localhost:9999/python-dev/index>, and clicking on the logo on the top left sends to <http://localhost:9999/python-dev>/
* <a href="#14:58.56" id="14:58.56">14:58.56 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: The one thing i *did not* do was to sync up TRACKER_HOME/db/files with the most current one from production
* <a href="#14:59.11" id="14:59.11">14:59.11 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Dont know if that can cause this duplicate key..
* <a href="#15:00.35" id="15:00.35">15:00.35 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr, interesting, does login using the localhost interface work?
* <a href="#15:02.01" id="15:02.01">15:02.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: nomicon, could it be that the id is determined by the files, and since you didn't sync those it create a file that already existed originally? e.g. you had file 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, in production but didn't sync, so locally you only had 1, 2, 3, and the next one created ended up being 4, even though you already had a file 4 in production
* <a href="#15:02.10" id="15:02.10">15:02.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, while creating a message will create a file under files/msgs, i would expect there to be no existing file at that location.
* <a href="#15:03.11" id="15:03.11">15:03.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, that's what I started thinking, but if his db had an id of 5, you would see files 1,2,3,6.... (I don;t remeber if ID is the free id or the last used ID at the moment).
* <a href="#15:03.58" id="15:03.58">15:03.58 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Taggnostr: that's my theory, that the INSERT INTO _msg... id=4  and that integer is based on the last value in db/files/msg3 +1
* <a href="#15:04.10" id="15:04.10">15:04.10 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, login works from either <http://localhost:9999/python-dev>/ or <http://localhost:9999/python-dev/index>, and after the login the URL is unchanged, trying to access localhost:9999 redirects me to <http://localhost:9999/python-dev/index>
* <a href="#15:04.11" id="15:04.11">15:04.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I know we fixed a problem where retired id's could cause a duplicate id issue when importing, but that was fixed.
* <a href="#15:04.54" id="15:04.54">15:04.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr ack on login. thanks for trying. yeah index is a special target apparently. it works on my trackers too.
* <a href="#15:05.06" id="15:05.06">15:05.06 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: id is only defined as integer in postgres. I come from mysql side of things, I believe those types are called auto_increment in mysql/maria, but couldnt find it in postgres so I was not sure
* <a href="#15:05.35" id="15:05.35">15:05.35 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: IIRC index is the default template if no template is specified, so you can omit it and it still works
* <a href="#15:05.51" id="15:05.51">15:05.51 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: and Im not bright enough to disect the python code to see if the code is responsible for calculating the id number to insert based of the filesystem files
* <a href="#15:06.02" id="15:06.02">15:06.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr ack. that sounds plausible.
* <a href="#15:06.09" id="15:06.09">15:06.09 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, and fwiw in the config I have web = <http://localhost:9999/python-dev>/
* <a href="#15:06.29" id="15:06.29">15:06.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ack.
* <a href="#15:06.43" id="15:06.43">15:06.43 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: (under the [tracker] section)
* <a href="#15:08.54" id="15:08.54">15:08.54 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: where would I even start to look how those id's are produced?
* <a href="#15:09.24" id="15:09.24">15:09.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, yeah I think there is an autoincrement in postgres.
* <a href="#15:10.34" id="15:10.34">15:10.34 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: hm, then my theory falls apart =D
* <a href="#15:10.34" id="15:10.34">15:10.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, its in backends/back_postgres.py the function is newid. It does a select nextval('_%s_ids') from dual"%classname
* <a href="#15:11.04" id="15:11.04">15:11.04 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: so then it has nothing to do with me not syncing up the db/ folder each time i've done an import
* <a href="#15:11.32" id="15:11.32">15:11.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: per the doc: nextval(regclass)            bigint            Advance sequence and return new value
* <a href="#15:11.52" id="15:11.52">15:11.52 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: ok
* <a href="#15:11.53" id="15:11.53">15:11.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: not for the rdbms back ends at least.
* <a href="#15:12.58" id="15:12.58">15:12.58 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: then Im a bit more confused on how I ended up with duplicate key
* <a href="#15:13.45" id="15:13.45">15:13.45 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: so after I build the docker container and I do a `docker run -it --rm -p 9017:8080 -v $PWD/tracker:/usr/src/app/tracker roundup-app:latest` I get the following error: <https://pastebin.com/raw/6CKfgfNM>
* <a href="#15:14.03" id="15:14.03">15:14.03 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: and it's because it changes my tracker folder ownership to root: drwxr-xr-x   2 root   root   4.0K Jan  4 14:11 tracker
* <a href="#15:14.16" id="15:14.16">15:14.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon I'm not sure.
* <a href="#15:14.17" id="15:14.17">15:14.17 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I ended up chown'ing it the first time I went through
* <a href="#15:14.36" id="15:14.36">15:14.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alxjsn, the tracker should run as user 1000.
* <a href="#15:14.39" id="15:14.39">15:14.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: not root.

* <a href="#15:17.49" id="15:17.49">15:17.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alxjsn, in the docker the roundup-tracker should run as uid 1000. So your tracker directory needs to be uid 1000. I haven;t figured out how to change that and make it persistent. Ideally it would look at the owner of the tracker directory and use that for any exec's run etc. but ....
* <a href="#15:18.15" id="15:18.15">15:18.15 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: after I chown it, I can continue with selecting a template/db, I modify the config.ini to have the correct web and domain variables, and then run the container again to finish the admin initialisation
* <a href="#15:18.27" id="15:18.27">15:18.27 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it shouldn't be chown'ing the tracker dir at all.

* <a href="#15:19.00" id="15:19.00">15:19.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: does $PWD/tracker exist before you run docker?
* <a href="#15:19.17" id="15:19.17">15:19.17 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: yes it exists and it is owned by my user which is 1000
* <a href="#15:19.29" id="15:19.29">15:19.29 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: and then after running the container the first time it changes to root
* <a href="#15:24.31" id="15:24.31">15:24.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that's not right. it doesn't (isn't supposed to) do anything as root.

* <a href="#15:27.51" id="15:27.51">15:27.51 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: it only happens the first time I run it after a build, it doesn't touch the ownership afterwards
