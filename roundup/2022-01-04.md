* <a href="#04:11.27" id="04:11.27">04:11.27 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: does the files in db/files/ need any conversions when upgrading roundup? Im moving from 1.4.20 to 2.x. Right now im just doing exporttables / importtables
* <a href="#04:11.45" id="04:11.45">04:11.45 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: would it be safe to just rsync this folder to the new instance?

Im just trying to figure out how I ended up in this situationen now.

* <a href="#14:14.26" id="14:14.26">14:14.26 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I am having trouble logging in with a new initialised instance. When I try using the admin password I don't get any error messages, just get redirected to the main page again
* <a href="#14:14.38" id="14:14.38">14:14.38 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: Anyone know why that might be? I'm using the docker container
* <a href="#14:17.59" id="14:17.59">14:17.59 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I'm also using the responsive template if that matters?
* <a href="#14:20.29" id="14:20.29">14:20.29 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: can you see any logs in the docker container?
* <a href="#14:21.51" id="14:21.51">14:21.51 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: 172.17.0.1 - - [04/Jan/2022 19:21:32] "POST / HTTP/1.1" 302 - 172.17.0.1 - - [04/Jan/2022 13:21:32] "GET /issues/index HTTP/1.1" 200 -

* <a href="#14:22.45" id="14:22.45">14:22.45 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: and in the left sidebar do you still see the login form, or something like "Hello, admin"?
* <a href="#14:23.18" id="14:23.18">14:23.18 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: It's still the login form

* <a href="#14:25.14" id="14:25.14">14:25.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: generally you would create a new user and use that, not sure if the docker container does that for you already
* <a href="#14:26.01" id="14:26.01">14:26.01 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: Yeah I went through the prompts in roundup-admin initialise and set the password through there
* <a href="#14:26.52" id="14:26.52">14:26.52 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I would at least expect an error message for incorrect logins

* <a href="#14:28.05" id="14:28.05">14:28.05 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: The response is always a 302 for every login post request
* <a href="#14:28.24" id="14:28.24">14:28.24 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: even with random users/passwords?
* <a href="#14:28.29" id="14:28.29">14:28.29 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: yeah
* <a href="#14:29.15" id="14:29.15">14:29.15 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: that seems weird, naybe the docker container is set up to do something different
* <a href="#14:29.34" id="14:29.34">14:29.34 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: I was actually getting 400 errors running with the master branch and then got 302s after using latest pypi version
* <a href="#14:30.05" id="14:30.05">14:30.05 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: well I guess I'll poke around some more
* <a href="#14:30.18" id="14:30.18">14:30.18 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj can probably help, but he seems afk now
* <a href="#14:31.26" id="14:31.26">14:31.26 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there should also be a demo include if you want to try that
* <a href="#14:32.29" id="14:32.29">14:32.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: make sure that your web = setting in the config file ends in /.

* <a href="#14:34.02" id="14:34.02">14:34.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it should have failed to start if it was missing the trailing /, but....
* <a href="#14:35.29" id="14:35.29">14:35.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, that may have been your 400 error. The docker config is a work in progress, so there may be some unseen issues. I did the best I could with docs, but I have been using roundup since 2001 so not a novice user.
* <a href="#14:35.49" id="14:35.49">14:35.49 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: currently using <http://localhost:9017>/
* <a href="#14:36.38" id="14:36.38">14:36.38 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and your docker is binding port 8080 to port 9017
* <a href="#14:37.01" id="14:37.01">14:37.01 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: yeah

* <a href="#14:38.24" id="14:38.24">14:38.24 (EST)</a> - __[alxjsn](https://github.com/alxjsn)__: for you*
* <a href="#14:38.26" id="14:38.26">14:38.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, at this point I would pull up the developer tools and see what cookies are returned.
* <a href="#14:38.54" id="14:38.54">14:38.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I usually use the classic template, but I expect the responsive template to work.
