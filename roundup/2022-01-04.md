* <a href="#02:05.20" id="02:05.20">02:05.20 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: thanks for the pointer about strace and manually.
* <a href="#02:06.10" id="02:06.10">02:06.10 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I would agree that its probably 'process file size limit' aswell. Only file in my TRACKER_HOME/log/ directory  is roundup.log, and if I truncate that file everything is fine
