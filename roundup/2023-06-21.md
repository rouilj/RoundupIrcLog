* <a href="#11:06.45" id="11:06.45">11:06.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: see: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/customizing.html> look for setlabelprop. In your schema.py, there maybe a setlabelprop call for the items defined in there. You should read the schema section <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/customizing.html#tracker-schema> to understand how the permissions are set and how to change the schema (if needed) to change permissions.
