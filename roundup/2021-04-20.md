# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-04-20
* <a href="#12:52.50" id="12:52.50">12:52.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m], I got around to testing using wsgi_liveserver.py. I have a test case set up and running. However using pytest-cov it reports that there is no
* <a href="#12:52.55" id="12:52.55">12:52.55 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: coverage data.
* <a href="#12:54.12" id="12:54.12">12:54.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: do you have any ideas here? If I can't get coverage data on the running server subprocess it makes running the server moot.
* <a href="#12:56.44" id="12:56.44">12:56.44 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am not doing anything special running: python3 -m pytest --cov=r -v test/test_liveserver.py where test_liveserver is at: <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/~rouilj/test_liveserver.py>

* <a href="#13:10.03" id="13:10.03">13:10.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: gah --cov=roundup not --cov=r sigh. It's working now. 77% coverage of wsgi_hander.py.
* <a href="#13:10.05" id="13:10.05">13:10.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Cool.
* <a href="#13:11.56" id="13:11.56">13:11.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] thanks for being my rubber ducky.  (although you are not the you in "you make bathtime so much fun"  -- Ernie)
