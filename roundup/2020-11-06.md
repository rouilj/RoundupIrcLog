* <a id="20:53.39">20:53.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so you can do text search of the logs.

This looks like it may help with testing the roundup web interface as well. Thoughts?
* <a id="20:59.16">20:59.16 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: It should be possible, but I haven't tried.
* <a id="21:00.18">21:00.18 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I think my original intention with wsgi-liveserver was to have some selenium tests for our internal helpdesk that is based on roundup, but I just never got around to it. It works fine for a few other internal bottle apps I maintain thought.
