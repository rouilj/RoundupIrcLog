* <a href="#20:56.10" id="20:56.10">20:56.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] I see https://github.com/jerrykan/wsgi-liveserver that interests me as I am using splinter for testing my sysadmin tracker. This looks like it may help with testing the roundup web interface as well. Thoughts?

* <a href="#21:00.18" id="21:00.18">21:00.18 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I think my original intention with wsgi-liveserver was to have some selenium tests for our internal helpdesk that is based on roundup, but I just never got around to it. It works fine for a few other internal bottle apps I maintain thought.
