# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-05-06
* <a href="#19:52.49" id="19:52.49">19:52.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr thanks for the pointer to the nosy autocomplete.
* <a href="#19:53.29" id="19:53.29">19:53.29 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: no problem :)
* <a href="#19:53.45" id="19:53.45">19:53.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am starting planing for the 20th anniversary release. I'll probbly do it on July 13 which is a few days later than the initial changelog message (7/11), but close enough.
* <a href="#19:54.25" id="19:54.25">19:54.25 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: nice
* <a href="#19:54.44" id="19:54.44">19:54.44 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I was hoping jerrykan was here as he has an open pull request I want to get ticketed and included.
* <a href="#19:55.02" id="19:55.02">19:55.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but it looks like I have nobody to carry my water.
* <a href="#19:59.09" id="19:59.09">19:59.09 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, do you know if using roundup.instance to access the instance of tracker that runs on python2 works from a standalone py3 script?
* <a href="#22:19.58" id="22:19.58">22:19.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't think so.  I am pretty sure every file in roundup 1.6.x -> 2.0.0 had some conversions needed for py3. Also py3 and py2 use incompatible versions of anydbm/bdb. I know roundup-demo and roundup-server break opening the session db if you run a py3 version of instance against a py2 version. Also vice versa.
* <a href="#22:20.20" id="22:20.20">22:20.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: But I can't say definitively.
* <a href="#22:20.32" id="22:20.32">22:20.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr above or in the logs.
* <a href="#23:10.32" id="23:10.32">23:10.32 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, ok, thanks :)
