# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-07-03
* <a href="#04:01.14" id="04:01.14">04:01.14 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: you're welcome to use either name. Yes, I'll send to roundup-users.
* <a href="#06:38.37" id="06:38.37">06:38.37 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: and I'm not sure about csrf defenses. I took the default config file from 2.0.0 and merged in the changes we had against 1.4.15 (i.e. did a three-way merge)
* <a href="#10:28.16" id="10:28.16">10:28.16 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalmp, in that case, you probably have them activated. grep for csrf through your config.ini. If they all come back with yes or required you should be fine.
