* <a href="#09:07.42" id="09:07.42">09:07.42 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: on the old copy on the old server it's listed in _modules as

* <a href="#09:08.35" id="09:08.35">09:08.35 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i re-entered it into the new server's  __init__.py and got the same error. module isn't listed as available

* <a href="#09:10.16" id="09:10.16">09:10.16 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oof ok

* <a href="#09:11.32" id="09:11.32">09:11.32 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i put it in the list further down in __init__.py on the for name in line and got some juicy python errors from the back_mssqlserver.py i ported

* <a href="#09:37.03" id="09:37.03">09:37.03 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: is this something i should try using instead? <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/python-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16>

* <a href="#11:48.42" id="11:48.42">11:48.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: randy_ using the same python that you are running roundup with can you run it and type 'import mssqlserver'

* <a href="#11:49.25" id="11:49.25">11:49.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Without seeing the error, I can't make  better guess. You may need to pip install mssqlserver.

* <a href="#11:55.22" id="11:55.22">11:55.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Regarding the microsoft page, I wonder if one of the two of those is the updated version of  mssqlserver that you have on your old system.
