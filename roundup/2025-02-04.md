* <a href="#09:07.07" id="09:07.07">09:07.07 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: found the file thanks!
* <a href="#09:07.42" id="09:07.42">09:07.42 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: on the old copy on the old server it's listed in _modules as

* <a href="#09:08.01" id="09:08.01">09:08.01 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: 'mssqlserver':('mssqlserver',),
* <a href="#09:08.35" id="09:08.35">09:08.35 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i re-entered it into the new server's  __init__.py and got the same error. module isn't listed as available

* <a href="#09:10.16" id="09:10.16">09:10.16 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oof ok

* <a href="#09:11.32" id="09:11.32">09:11.32 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i put it in the list further down in __init__.py on the for name in line and got some juicy python errors from the back_mssqlserver.py i ported

* <a href="#09:37.03" id="09:37.03">09:37.03 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: is this something i should try using instead? <https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/python/python-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver16>

* <a href="#11:48.42" id="11:48.42">11:48.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: randy_ using the same python that you are running roundup with can you run it and type 'import mssqlserver'

* <a href="#11:49.25" id="11:49.25">11:49.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Without seeing the error, I can't make  better guess. You may need to pip install mssqlserver.

* <a href="#11:55.22" id="11:55.22">11:55.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Regarding the microsoft page, I wonder if one of the two of those is the updated version of  mssqlserver that you have on your old system.

* <a href="#12:00.18" id="12:00.18">12:00.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Scratch that. They would be a layer over what mssqlserver calls.
* <a href="#12:00.29" id="12:00.29">12:00.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: For mssqlserver you need odbc and dbi python packages installed.

* <a href="#12:01.22" id="12:01.22">12:01.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: no need to 'pip install mssqlserver'. That won't work. It is your local mssqlserver.py file from the old installation.

* <a href="#12:02.22" id="12:02.22">12:02.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: So new directions:
* <a href="#12:02.25" id="12:02.25">12:02.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: 1) run the same python you are using to start Roundup.
* <a href="#12:03.21" id="12:03.21">12:03.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Are you using a venv/virtual env?

* <a href="#12:05.09" id="12:05.09">12:05.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: if so you don;t need to add Roundup to your path. If you do you may need to add the parent directory for the installed roundup using the PYTHONPATH env variable or some python command line switch. I am going to assume you can do an 'import roundup' in your running python.

* <a href="#12:05.34" id="12:05.34">12:05.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: 2) type 'import roundup.back_mssqlserver'
* <a href="#12:05.41" id="12:05.41">12:05.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: it should complete without output
* <a href="#12:05.56" id="12:05.56">12:05.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: 2) type 'import odbc'
* <a href="#12:06.09" id="12:06.09">12:06.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: it shuld complete without error

* <a href="#12:06.29" id="12:06.29">12:06.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: 4) type 'import dbi' it should complete without error.
* <a href="#12:06.51" id="12:06.51">12:06.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: If odbc or dbi imports fail, you need to use pip to install them on your system.

* <a href="#12:11.26" id="12:11.26">12:11.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: I am not sure where to get odbc or dbi. possibly pyodbc might work if you change the import to 'import pyodbc as odbc' you may not have to change the other code that references odbc.

* <a href="#12:13.43" id="12:13.43">12:13.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: I can't find a source for dbi. AFAICT it's not used in back_mssqlserver.py. So it may not be needed. Try removing the import dbi and just use 'import pyodbc as odbc' maybe?

* <a href="#12:16.28" id="12:16.28">12:16.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: maybe try looking at `pip list` using your old environment to see what package is listed for dbi. But I don't think you will need it. You can also see what odbc package is installed in the old environment.

* <a href="#12:17.42" id="12:17.42">12:17.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: BTW pyodbc is the top recommended one from the microsoft page.
