* <a href="#12:44.12" id="12:44.12">12:44.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yo yo B-) new question, i need to back up. i'm not entirely sure what version i'm currently on. i just made an assumption based on what install files i found sitting around. how do i check what version issue tracker is currently on? i see the roundup bug tracker + python service running, but i don't see version info. I see it running python25 with -C roundup-server.ini as a parameter. but no version # beyond that.

* <a href="#12:50.48" id="12:50.48">12:50.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: look in the roundup install directory in the __init__.py file.

* <a href="#12:52.23" id="12:52.23">12:52.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think running roundup-admin also displays the version, but ....

* <a href="#13:03.27" id="13:03.27">13:03.27 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: * /roundup/trackers/**** is where my install directory is, right? it's where my config.ini and roundup-server.ini are
* <a href="#13:03.52" id="13:03.52">13:03.52 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: but i do not see a _init_.py file or a roundup-admin to run in that directory
* <a href="#13:04.22" id="13:04.22">13:04.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ no that's your tracker home (well homes)

* <a href="#13:04.37" id="13:04.37">13:04.37 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh oh
* <a href="#13:04.39" id="13:04.39">13:04.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if it has a config.ini it's a tracker's home directory.
* <a href="#13:04.47" id="13:04.47">13:04.47 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok understood

* <a href="#13:06.33" id="13:06.33">13:06.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: try running "python -c 'import roundup; print(roundup.__file__)'"
* <a href="#13:07.24" id="13:07.24">13:07.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that should show you where __init__.py is. You might have to mess with quoting on windows. Are you using powershell or cmd as your terminal shell?

* <a href="#13:09.56" id="13:09.56">13:09.56 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ahh got it. thanks man

* <a href="#13:10.37" id="13:10.37">13:10.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and the version is ...... <the crowd hushes expectantly>
* <a href="#13:10.45" id="13:10.45">13:10.45 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: it's installed in the python25 directory. i'm on version 1.4.15. that should get me going again
* <a href="#13:11.01" id="13:11.01">13:11.01 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ty :)

* <a href="#13:15.16" id="13:15.16">13:15.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you're welcome. That's better. only 14 years old. Note you might still need to check the tracker home directories for issues going back to 1.4.4. I would hope that all the upgrading steps had been done if it really was a 2008 1.4.4 upgrade to 2010 1.4.15 tracker. But it sounds like you don't have docs on that. (btw would it have been tracked in  the tracker?? Kind of meta but...)

* <a href="#13:16.59" id="13:16.59">13:16.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the next thing to check is the underlying database library. In the roundup install directory, what module is being imported in backend/back_mssqlserver.py.

* <a href="#13:18.09" id="13:18.09">13:18.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I want to make sure you and I have identified all the actors in this play before we start the show.

* <a href="#13:22.30" id="13:22.30">13:22.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also, who handles running your mssql server. It might be worth duplicating the existing database so you have a non-production database to work against and possibly a second duplicate for restoration. Not sure how big the roundup db is, or if you have the space. Also testing your existing db backups is important here as the versions of roundup you are going to have not been tested with the mssqlserver back end. You may need to co
* <a href="#13:22.32" id="13:22.32">13:22.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: database migrations that are needed by newer roundups. I'll check and see what migrartions happened between 1.4.15 and 2.4.0.

* <a href="#13:23.35" id="13:23.35">13:23.35 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: actually better is to have you tell me what roundup database version you are using. Can you use a sql client to connect to the db?

* <a href="#13:29.55" id="13:29.55">13:29.55 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the comments in back_mssqlserver.py say its a modified version of back_postgresql.py. is that what module you're looking for?

* <a href="#13:30.39" id="13:30.39">13:30.39 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: we did already clone the application and db to separate machines. i'm working off those clones now
* <a href="#13:30.50" id="13:30.50">13:30.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: perfect.

* <a href="#13:31.20" id="13:31.20">13:31.20 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah let me find db creds
* <a href="#13:31.20" id="13:31.20">13:31.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: regarding the module, nope it's good to know where the source came from that might make things easier.
* <a href="#13:31.50" id="13:31.50">13:31.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: #$Id: back_mssqlserver.py,v 1 2009-08-20 Zuriel Correa $ # # Copyright (c) 2009 # # This module is free software, and you may redistribute it and/or modify # under the same terms as Python, so long as this copyright message and # disclaimer are retained in their original form. # '''MS Sql Server backend via odbc for Roundup.''' #Note that this file is a modified copy of back_postgresql.py
* <a href="#13:31.51" id="13:31.51">13:31.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am looking for n import mssql or something in msssqlserver.py.
* <a href="#13:32.03" id="13:32.03">13:32.03 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh one sec

* <a href="#13:32.30" id="13:32.30">13:32.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: odbc. got it. I assume there is an import odbc or something in the top of that file.
* <a href="#13:32.50" id="13:32.50">13:32.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yep tep
* <a href="#13:33.11" id="13:33.11">13:33.11 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: import dbi, odbc

* <a href="#13:33.21" id="13:33.21">13:33.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: cool.
* <a href="#13:33.45" id="13:33.45">13:33.45 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: let me find db creds and i'll check the db version
* <a href="#13:33.49" id="13:33.49">13:33.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: That's actually useful. Can you check with your company and see if they would be willing to release that file at some point.
* <a href="#13:34.06" id="13:34.06">13:34.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ the db version I need is the roundup schema version.
* <a href="#13:34.16" id="13:34.16">13:34.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so not quite what I think you expect.

* <a href="#13:34.39" id="13:34.39">13:34.39 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh understood. not the literal engine # version of mssql
* <a href="#13:34.46" id="13:34.46">13:34.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: as you know roundup mutates the schema on the db server in demand based on changed to schema.py.
* <a href="#13:35.02" id="13:35.02">13:35.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy correct not literal engine

* <a href="#13:36.01" id="13:36.01">13:36.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the indexes and things it uses and expects (e.g. full text search tables, other table indexes) are encoded into a json blob, Does mssql have methods/functions for decoding json?

* <a href="#13:37.07" id="13:37.07">13:37.07 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: (note I am currently on one of my sqlite based trackers and trying to remember what has to happen to extract the schema version)
* <a href="#13:37.19" id="13:37.19">13:37.19 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so this might take a beat or two

* <a href="#13:43.23" id="13:43.23">13:43.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: It turns out it's not json. In your sql client run: 'select schema from schema;' you will get a wall of text. It's a representation of the current state of schema.py. One field in there is called "version". I need the value of version.

* <a href="#13:47.44" id="13:47.44">13:47.44 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I hope it's at schema version 5.
* <a href="#13:47.56" id="13:47.56">13:47.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: (it's the same for 1.4.4 and 1.4.15)
* <a href="#13:48.11" id="13:48.11">13:48.11 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok i'm on the db. "select schema from schema;" is invalid syntax
* <a href="#13:48.42" id="13:48.42">13:48.42 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: dbo.schema?

* <a href="#13:49.10" id="13:49.10">13:49.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: is schema a reserved word in mssql? Try: 'select `schema` from `schema`;'

* <a href="#13:50.02" id="13:50.02">13:50.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: dbo.schema don;t know. dbo to me sounds like a programming term for data base object. I wouldn;t expect it to be required in an interactive database shell. But  don;t know the mssql ecosystem so....

* <a href="#13:50.51" id="13:50.51">13:50.51 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok double quote schema returned something
* <a href="#13:51.06" id="13:51.06">13:51.06 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: version: 5
* <a href="#13:51.10" id="13:51.10">13:51.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok goo.
* <a href="#13:51.14" id="13:51.14">13:51.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: good.

* <a href="#13:52.16" id="13:52.16">13:52.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Roundup when it changes the schema version runs code in the back_.... modules that can be unique for each backend. I'm trying to find out what schema changes have to be done.
* <a href="#13:52.34" id="13:52.34">13:52.34 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok! ty
* <a href="#13:52.51" id="13:52.51">13:52.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If it needs custom code for mssql, you'll have to add it to back_mssqlserver.py an get it to run during an upgrade.

* <a href="#13:53.50" id="13:53.50">13:53.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: is back_mssqlserver.py what runs and makes schema changes as like an initialization process
* <a href="#13:53.54" id="13:53.54">13:53.54 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ?

* <a href="#13:54.09" id="13:54.09">13:54.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: lt me do some research about the changes. If we needed code for postgresql, chances are we need it for mssqlserver to. (Good thing we know what backend the mssqserver is based on)
* <a href="#13:54.56" id="13:54.56">13:54.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: when you upgrade the first thing you run is 'roundup-admin migrate'

* <a href="#13:55.33" id="13:55.33">13:55.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: this opens the database, checks the schema version. If it doesn't match the version it runs the schema upgrade migration process.

* <a href="#13:56.38" id="13:56.38">13:56.38 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ah ok. so just once on install/upgrade/migration it will do a schema check/fix. not when the service runs?
* <a href="#13:56.54" id="13:56.54">13:56.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the code to do the migration is in rdbms_common.py (look for upgrade_db)

* <a href="#13:57.14" id="13:57.14">13:57.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "o just once on install/upgrade/migration it will do a schema check/fix. not when the service runs?" well that's the dirty little secret.
* <a href="#13:57.42" id="13:57.42">13:57.42 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: :o

* <a href="#13:58.29" id="13:58.29">13:58.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it actually does the schema check and if there's a mismatch the  upgrade. Roundup can have multiple clients accessing the db: roundup web server; roundup email; roundup-admin ....;
* <a href="#13:59.09" id="13:59.09">13:59.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: image what happens if a process has the db open and another process changes the schema underneath it.

* <a href="#13:59.50" id="13:59.50">13:59.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the integrity and state of your data and db just goes out the window?

* <a href="#14:00.32" id="14:00.32">14:00.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So the rule is when upgrading the software (which is the only time the schema version will change) you shut all the old softare down. Install the new software; run only roundup-admin migrate to upgrade the roudup schema; run other programs that will see the schema is the expected one.

* <a href="#14:01.45" id="14:01.45">14:01.45 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i did see that the documentation absolutely insists upon shutting down services before runnig anything
* <a href="#14:01.46" id="14:01.46">14:01.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "he integrity and state of your data and db just goes out the window?" - well it's possible. More likely you will get a crash when it tires to access something that has been removed/changed or the type is incompatible.
* <a href="#14:02.20" id="14:02.20">14:02.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "absolutely insists upon shutting down" yup now you know why 8-).

* <a href="#14:02.28" id="14:02.28">14:02.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s/tires/tries/

* <a href="#14:03.48" id="14:03.48">14:03.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Some db backends aren't the best at exposing an underlying failure to the python code. So best not to confusing things.
* <a href="#14:04.18" id="14:04.18">14:04.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: understood. thanks for the tip
* <a href="#14:04.18" id="14:04.18">14:04.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Modifying schema.py is similar.

* <a href="#14:04.26" id="14:04.26">14:04.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: np.
* <a href="#14:04.52" id="14:04.52">14:04.52 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: let me go see what changes are needed between version 5 and 8.
* <a href="#14:04.58" id="14:04.58">14:04.58 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i'm not a python or db expert so this is all good to know. kinda just winging it right now
* <a href="#14:05.06" id="14:05.06">14:05.06 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok, ty

* <a href="#14:20.03" id="14:20.03">14:20.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ an posterity if you want a little more info on extracting schema version, see: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/reference.html#schema-integrity>. I knew I wrote it down somewhere 8-).

* <a href="#14:23.34" id="14:23.34">14:23.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok. Got the info. You have two migrations to do. Both can wait until you go from 2.0.0 -> 2.4.0. So upgrading from 1.4.15 to 1.6.1 should be straight forward with what you have. That will keep you on python 2.

* <a href="#14:28.44" id="14:28.44">14:28.44 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok thanks! do i need to follow the upgrade step by step from 1.4.15 to 1.6.1? I don't see a header item in the upgrade documentation to go straight to 1.6.1 from 1.4.x

* <a href="#14:32.44" id="14:32.44">14:32.44 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you have to do each step from 1.4.x -> 1.4.17 all the way to x->1.6.1.  That whole sequence is 1.4.15 -> 1.6.1. The upgrade directions are incremental. Since the upgrade step prior to 1.4.x -> 1.4.17 was for 1.4.x -> 1.4.12 and you are on .15 I hope/assume whoever did the 1.4.15 upgrade followed the 1.4.x -> 1.4.12 upgrade directions.

* <a href="#14:34.32" id="14:34.32">14:34.32 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok understood. thanks man. i'm going to crunch at that route for a bit and hopefully return with victory
* <a href="#14:34.50" id="14:34.50">14:34.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You might want to check that the upgrade directions for 1.4.x -> 1.4.7 are present in your current tracker.
* <a href="#14:35.08" id="14:35.08">14:35.08 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Are you using any sort of VCS (git, etc) for your tracker files?

* <a href="#14:35.50" id="14:35.50">14:35.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: you mentioned you wanted my back_mssqlserver.py when i'm done and it works and my org approves?
* <a href="#14:35.57" id="14:35.57">14:35.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume not but... consider taking what you have and putting it under a VCS. Then commit once you have done each upgrade step.

* <a href="#14:36.18" id="14:36.18">14:36.18 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: nah i'm gonna be rawdogging it with notepad plus plus
* <a href="#14:36.53" id="14:36.53">14:36.53 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah i'll go back through the earlier 1.4.x change instructions and confirm they were applied

* <a href="#14:38.26" id="14:38.26">14:38.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "you wanted my back_mssqlserver.py". Yes that would be nice. We have a wiki for that and you can post it there with the license agreement. Since it uses dbi and odbc, I would like to adopt it into the core code. IIRC that combo should work as a good base for adding oracle support as well.

* <a href="#14:40.12" id="14:40.12">14:40.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I strongly urge you to use git/fossil/something even if you are using np++. These upgrades can get tricky. Being able to bisect changes to find issues is really useful. Not to mention you make it easier for those in the future who upgrade from 2.4 to 2.98 8-).
