# Roundup IRC Log for 2024-12-19
* <a href="#12:44.12" id="12:44.12">12:44.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yo yo B-) new question, i need to back up. i'm not entirely sure what version i'm currently on. i just made an assumption based on what install files i found sitting around. how do i check what version issue tracker is currently on? i see the roundup bug tracker + python service running, but i don't see version info. I see it running python25 with -C roundup-server.ini as a parameter. but no version # beyond that.
