# Roundup IRC Log for 2024-12-19
* <a href="#12:44.12" id="12:44.12">12:44.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yo yo B-) new question, i need to back up. i'm not entirely sure what version i'm currently on. i just made an assumption based on what install files i found sitting around. how do i check what version issue tracker is currently on? i see the roundup bug tracker + python service running, but i don't see version info. I see it running python25 with -C roundup-server.ini as a parameter. but no version # beyond that.

* <a href="#12:50.48" id="12:50.48">12:50.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: look in the roundup install directory in the __init__.py file.

* <a href="#12:52.23" id="12:52.23">12:52.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think running roundup-admin also displays the version, but ....

* <a href="#13:03.27" id="13:03.27">13:03.27 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: * /roundup/trackers/**** is where my install directory is, right? it's where my config.ini and roundup-server.ini are
* <a href="#13:03.52" id="13:03.52">13:03.52 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: but i do not see a _init_.py file or a roundup-admin to run in that directory
* <a href="#13:04.22" id="13:04.22">13:04.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ no that's your tracker home (well homes)

* <a href="#13:04.37" id="13:04.37">13:04.37 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh oh
* <a href="#13:04.39" id="13:04.39">13:04.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if it has a config.ini it's a tracker's home directory.
* <a href="#13:04.47" id="13:04.47">13:04.47 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok understood

* <a href="#13:06.33" id="13:06.33">13:06.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: try running "python -c 'import roundup; print(roundup.__file__)'"
* <a href="#13:07.24" id="13:07.24">13:07.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that should show you where __init__.py is. You might have to mess with quoting on windows. Are you using powershell or cmd as your terminal shell?
