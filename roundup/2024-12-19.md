* <a href="#12:44.12" id="12:44.12">12:44.12 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yo yo B-) new question, i need to back up. i'm not entirely sure what version i'm currently on. i just made an assumption based on what install files i found sitting around. how do i check what version issue tracker is currently on? i see the roundup bug tracker + python service running, but i don't see version info. I see it running python25 with -C roundup-server.ini as a parameter. but no version # beyond that.

* <a href="#12:50.48" id="12:50.48">12:50.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: look in the roundup install directory in the __init__.py file.

* <a href="#12:52.23" id="12:52.23">12:52.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think running roundup-admin also displays the version, but ....

* <a href="#13:03.27" id="13:03.27">13:03.27 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: * /roundup/trackers/**** is where my install directory is, right? it's where my config.ini and roundup-server.ini are
* <a href="#13:03.52" id="13:03.52">13:03.52 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: but i do not see a _init_.py file or a roundup-admin to run in that directory
* <a href="#13:04.22" id="13:04.22">13:04.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ no that's your tracker home (well homes)

* <a href="#13:04.37" id="13:04.37">13:04.37 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh oh
* <a href="#13:04.39" id="13:04.39">13:04.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if it has a config.ini it's a tracker's home directory.
* <a href="#13:04.47" id="13:04.47">13:04.47 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok understood

* <a href="#13:06.33" id="13:06.33">13:06.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: try running "python -c 'import roundup; print(roundup.__file__)'"
* <a href="#13:07.24" id="13:07.24">13:07.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that should show you where __init__.py is. You might have to mess with quoting on windows. Are you using powershell or cmd as your terminal shell?

* <a href="#13:09.56" id="13:09.56">13:09.56 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ahh got it. thanks man

* <a href="#13:10.37" id="13:10.37">13:10.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and the version is ...... <the crowd hushes expectantly>
* <a href="#13:10.45" id="13:10.45">13:10.45 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: it's installed in the python25 directory. i'm on version 1.4.15. that should get me going again
* <a href="#13:11.01" id="13:11.01">13:11.01 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ty :)

* <a href="#13:15.16" id="13:15.16">13:15.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you're welcome. That's better. only 14 years old. Note you might still need to check the tracker home directories for issues going back to 1.4.4. I would hope that all the upgrading steps had been done if it really was a 2008 1.4.4 upgrade to 2010 1.4.15 tracker. But it sounds like you don't have docs on that. (btw would it have been tracked in  the tracker?? Kind of meta but...)

* <a href="#13:16.59" id="13:16.59">13:16.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the next thing to check is the underlying database library. In the roundup install directory, what module is being imported in backend/back_mssqlserver.py.

* <a href="#13:18.09" id="13:18.09">13:18.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I want to make sure you and I have identified all the actors in this play before we start the show.

* <a href="#13:22.30" id="13:22.30">13:22.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also, who handles running your mssql server. It might be worth duplicating the existing database so you have a non-production database to work against and possibly a second duplicate for restoration. Not sure how big the roundup db is, or if you have the space. Also testing your existing db backups is important here as the versions of roundup you are going to have not been tested with the mssqlserver back end. You may need to co
* <a href="#13:22.32" id="13:22.32">13:22.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: database migrations that are needed by newer roundups. I'll check and see what migrartions happened between 1.4.15 and 2.4.0.

* <a href="#13:23.35" id="13:23.35">13:23.35 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: actually better is to have you tell me what roundup database version you are using. Can you use a sql client to connect to the db?

* <a href="#13:29.55" id="13:29.55">13:29.55 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the comments in back_mssqlserver.py say its a modified version of back_postgresql.py. is that what module you're looking for?

* <a href="#13:30.39" id="13:30.39">13:30.39 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: we did already clone the application and db to separate machines. i'm working off those clones now
* <a href="#13:30.50" id="13:30.50">13:30.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: perfect.

* <a href="#13:31.20" id="13:31.20">13:31.20 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah let me find db creds
* <a href="#13:31.20" id="13:31.20">13:31.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: regarding the module, nope it's good to know where the source came from that might make things easier.
* <a href="#13:31.50" id="13:31.50">13:31.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: #$Id: back_mssqlserver.py,v 1 2009-08-20 Zuriel Correa $ # # Copyright (c) 2009 # # This module is free software, and you may redistribute it and/or modify # under the same terms as Python, so long as this copyright message and # disclaimer are retained in their original form. # '''MS Sql Server backend via odbc for Roundup.''' #Note that this file is a modified copy of back_postgresql.py

* <a href="#13:32.30" id="13:32.30">13:32.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: odbc. got it. I assume there is an import odbc or something in the top of that file.
* <a href="#13:32.50" id="13:32.50">13:32.50 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yep tep
* <a href="#13:33.11" id="13:33.11">13:33.11 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: import dbi, odbc

* <a href="#13:33.21" id="13:33.21">13:33.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: cool.
* <a href="#13:33.45" id="13:33.45">13:33.45 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: let me find db creds and i'll check the db version
* <a href="#13:33.49" id="13:33.49">13:33.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: That's actually useful. Can you check with your company and see if they would be willing to release that file at some point.
* <a href="#13:34.06" id="13:34.06">13:34.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ the db version I need is the roundup schema version.
* <a href="#13:34.16" id="13:34.16">13:34.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so not quite what I think you expect.

* <a href="#13:34.39" id="13:34.39">13:34.39 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: oh understood. not the literal engine # version of mssql
* <a href="#13:34.46" id="13:34.46">13:34.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: as you know roundup mutates the schema on the db server in demand based on changed to schema.py.
* <a href="#13:35.02" id="13:35.02">13:35.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy correct not literal engine
