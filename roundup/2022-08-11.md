* <a href="#02:38.20" id="02:38.20">02:38.20 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: not sure, but I take it from "Oh DAMMIT" that he realised something, so hopefully he has it running now, lets see :) And btw, nice steps there with nc and curl
* <a href="#10:33.20" id="10:33.20">10:33.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah gotcha. Thanks. I used telnet/nc a lot for debugging other services in the past (e.g. I used to be able to talk SMTP and other protocols).
