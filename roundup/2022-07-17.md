# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-07-17
* <a href="#12:14.23" id="12:14.23">12:14.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I just deployed the IRC logs to sourceforge at: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/cgi-bin/roundup_irc_logs>
* <a href="#12:16.00" id="12:16.00">12:16.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So it will handle serving up the searchable logs. I still have some work to do as far as skinning the site. It doesn't share the layout of the rest of the roundup properties but at least it is more usable than the github version of the logs.
* <a href="#12:34.13" id="12:34.13">12:34.13 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but it may not stay there. Just got a corrupt repo. So the underlying file system may not be reliable enough for fossil 8-(.
* <a href="#12:48.46" id="12:48.46">12:48.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: switched back to github
* <a href="#12:48.53" id="12:48.53">12:48.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 8-(
* <a href="#14:55.00" id="14:55.00">14:55.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: testing after move back
