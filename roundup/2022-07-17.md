# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-07-17
* <a href="#12:14.23" id="12:14.23">12:14.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I just deployed the IRC logs to sourceforge at: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/cgi-bin/roundup_irc_logs>
* <a href="#12:16.00" id="12:16.00">12:16.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So it will handle serving up the searchable logs. I still have some work to do as far as skinning the site. It doesn't share the layout of the rest of the roundup properties but at least it is more usable than the github version of the logs.
