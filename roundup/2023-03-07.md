# Roundup IRC Log for 2023-03-07
* <a href="#02:42.27" id="02:42.27">02:42.27 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Is it really a core job/function for roundup to be able to server assets in the most efficient way? If I were an admin of an instance where this was a problem, I would probably try to solve it with some webproxy that handles this task specifically, perhaps nginx ?

* <a href="#04:57.29" id="04:57.29">04:57.29 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: That was my first thought as well. I use Apache to server up the @@file files directly from disk instead of via Roundup (which I think might also be the documented way to do it)... so it would seem to fall into a similar use-case.

* <a href="#06:23.52" id="06:23.52">06:23.52 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I can only assume that in many cases the roundup instance is part of a bigger setup where this might already be partly solved, or that the admin atleast does not expect an issue tracking software to solve it for them.
