* <a href="#04:20.54" id="04:20.54">04:20.54 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: Hi, very new to Roundup and Python with modest IT knowledge. I'm having trouble configuring my tracker can anyone help? Thanks.

* <a href="#04:21.37" id="04:21.37">04:21.37 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: qwebirc27483: It would be better if you could be more specific

* <a href="#04:26.04" id="04:26.04">04:26.04 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: When I go to initialise the tracker and enter an admin password I get Error: In C:\Roundup\Trackers/config.ini - MAIL_DOMAIN is not set and has no default.

* <a href="#04:30.00" id="04:30.00">04:30.00 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: If I open the config.ini at the top it says " WARNING! Following options need adjustments:[tracker]: web [mail]: domain, host. What do I need to change these values to? Sorry if its a dumb question but I've not done anything like this before.

* <a href="#04:53.23" id="04:53.23">04:53.23 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/reference.html>
* <a href="#04:53.56" id="04:53.56">04:53.56 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/reference.html?highlight=mail_domain>

* <a href="#05:15.44" id="05:15.44">05:15.44 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: I've looked at those documents but still unsure what I need to enter next to '#  [mail]: domain, host' in the config.ini file. Is it the domain and host of an email address? Sorry I'm pretty lost.

* <a href="#06:30.20" id="06:30.20">06:30.20 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: Is there a default value I can give to #  [mail]: 'domain, host' to allow the tracker to initialise? How do I set the MAIL_DOMAIN? Would it for example be something like  #  [mail]: Domain = '@gmail.com', Host = 'smtp.gmail.com' in the config.ini file?

* <a href="#08:52.56" id="08:52.56">08:52.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc27483 hopefully you will see this in the logs. I set it to localhost. E.G. domain = localhost  it is used in the from address if you have email sent.

* <a href="#10:11.00" id="10:11.00">10:11.00 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc15703](https://github.com/qwebirc15703)__: Hi, still attempting to initialise tracker. I have found where to enter Mail domain and host values in config.ini. I have entered a SMTP username and password in the appropriate sections but get Error: Invalid value for MAIL_PASSWORD: 'not defined' what am I doing wrong?

* <a href="#10:18.12" id="10:18.12">10:18.12 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc15703](https://github.com/qwebirc15703)__: Also I notice in the config.ini under SMTP password:  A string that starts with 'file://' is interpreted # as a file path relative to the tracker home. Using # 'file:///' defines an absolute path. The first # line of the file will be used as the value. Any # string that does not start with 'file://' is used # as is. It removes any whitespace at the end of the # line, so a newline can be put in the file. Can
* <a href="#10:18.29" id="10:18.29">10:18.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if you get disconnected you can check the logs.  <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/fossil/roundup_irc_logs>/ or <https://github.com/rouilj/test>

* <a href="#10:20.18" id="10:20.18">10:20.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am not sure why you are getting an invalid value for MAIL_PASSWORD. I'll check the code in a minute.

* <a href="#10:21.06" id="10:21.06">10:21.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Regarding file://... yes. Running inside docker/k8s or just for security you can store secrets in a file and have roundup read the file when it starts.
* <a href="#10:21.45" id="10:21.45">10:21.45 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if you are using git or some other VCS you can ignore the secrets stored outside of the file file so they don;t get committed accidently.

* <a href="#10:24.00" id="10:24.00">10:24.00 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc15703](https://github.com/qwebirc15703)__: Thanks for letting me know about the logs. So what your saying is I could have the SMTP password stored in a file and direct Roundup to read the file to access the password?

* <a href="#10:24.45" id="10:24.45">10:24.45 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct
* <a href="#10:25.02" id="10:25.02">10:25.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: however I am not sure why you ar getting an error for MAIL_PASSWORD

* <a href="#10:27.39" id="10:27.39">10:27.39 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc15703](https://github.com/qwebirc15703)__: So if I choose not to put a username and password for SMTP although I think it is required for authentication I get 'Error: In C:\Roundup\Trackers/config.ini - MAIL_DOMAIN is not set and has no default' even with the values entered in the appropriate sections.

* <a href="#10:29.00" id="10:29.00">10:29.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: have you set mail domain to localhost?
* <a href="#10:29.12" id="10:29.12">10:29.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I can't reproduce your issue.

* <a href="#10:29.28" id="10:29.28">10:29.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Try this. run roundup-admin -i your_tracker_home
* <a href="#10:29.58" id="10:29.58">10:29.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: they run 'display user1' at the roundup> prompt.

* <a href="#10:37.17" id="10:37.17">10:37.17 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you are running in a virtual environment corretc?

* <a href="#10:39.59" id="10:39.59">10:39.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: bah see: <https://python.land/virtual-environments/virtualenv#Python_venv_activation> for command to activate the environment in windows.

If I want to use roundup-admin I have to type: python oundup-2.3.0oundup\scriptsoundup_admin.py
