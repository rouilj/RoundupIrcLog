* <a href="#04:20.54" id="04:20.54">04:20.54 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: Hi, very new to Roundup and Python with modest IT knowledge. I'm having trouble configuring my tracker can anyone help? Thanks.

* <a href="#04:21.37" id="04:21.37">04:21.37 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: qwebirc27483: It would be better if you could be more specific

* <a href="#04:26.04" id="04:26.04">04:26.04 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: When I go to initialise the tracker and enter an admin password I get Error: In C:\Roundup\Trackers/config.ini - MAIL_DOMAIN is not set and has no default.

* <a href="#04:30.00" id="04:30.00">04:30.00 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: If I open the config.ini at the top it says " WARNING! Following options need adjustments:[tracker]: web [mail]: domain, host. What do I need to change these values to? Sorry if its a dumb question but I've not done anything like this before.

* <a href="#05:15.44" id="05:15.44">05:15.44 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: I've looked at those documents but still unsure what I need to enter next to '#  [mail]: domain, host' in the config.ini file. Is it the domain and host of an email address? Sorry I'm pretty lost.

* <a href="#06:30.20" id="06:30.20">06:30.20 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc27483](https://github.com/qwebirc27483)__: Is there a default value I can give to #  [mail]: 'domain, host' to allow the tracker to initialise? How do I set the MAIL_DOMAIN? Would it for example be something like  #  [mail]: Domain = '@gmail.com', Host = 'smtp.gmail.com' in the config.ini file?

* <a href="#08:52.56" id="08:52.56">08:52.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc27483 hopefully you will see this in the logs. I set it to localhost. E.G. domain = localhost  it is used in the from address if you have email sent.

* <a href="#10:11.00" id="10:11.00">10:11.00 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc15703](https://github.com/qwebirc15703)__: Hi, still attempting to initialise tracker. I have found where to enter Mail domain and host values in config.ini. I have entered a SMTP username and password in the appropriate sections but get Error: Invalid value for MAIL_PASSWORD: 'not defined' what am I doing wrong?

* <a href="#10:18.12" id="10:18.12">10:18.12 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc15703](https://github.com/qwebirc15703)__: Also I notice in the config.ini under SMTP password:  A string that starts with 'file://' is interpreted # as a file path relative to the tracker home. Using # 'file:///' defines an absolute path. The first # line of the file will be used as the value. Any # string that does not start with 'file://' is used # as is. It removes any whitespace at the end of the # line, so a newline can be put in the file. Can
