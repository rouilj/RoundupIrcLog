# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-12-13
* <a href="#05:27.42" id="05:27.42">05:27.42 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: not sure if you remember, but a while back I had problem with python2 Long suffixes in my DB. You provided me with a patch to roundup/anypy/strings.py to be implemented before executing roundup-admin importtables. It worked really well.  Now I've setup a lab-VM and working my way through my migration documentation, and all of sudden importtables gives me a stack trace
* <a href="#05:27.47" id="05:27.47">05:27.47 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <https://paste.centos.org/view/eec85883>
* <a href="#05:28.05" id="05:28.05">05:28.05 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Its executed like this /usr/local/bin/roundup-admin -i /opt/roundup/trackers/cendio-tracker importtables ./export_tables_1.6.0
* <a href="#05:32.13" id="05:32.13">05:32.13 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: not sure where that % is coming from..
* <a href="#08:44.15" id="08:44.15">08:44.15 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Ok its not just importtables, anything related to roundup-admin gives the same trace..
* <a href="#08:51.36" id="08:51.36">08:51.36 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: nvm. I had a malformed config.ini in extensions/ folder
* <a href="#08:53.39" id="08:53.39">08:53.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ack glad you found it. Do you have the contents of the malformed config.ini? That should give a better error message. Something like malformed line 22 in extensions/config.ini.
* <a href="#08:55.29" id="08:55.29">08:55.29 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <https://paste.centos.org/view/fa8e22ec>
* <a href="#08:55.47" id="08:55.47">08:55.47 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: it was the line starting with userfilter that only hade one %s
* <a href="#08:55.52" id="08:55.52">08:55.52 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: it should've been %%s
* <a href="#09:01.35" id="09:01.35">09:01.35 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thanks.
* <a href="#11:31.41" id="11:31.41">11:31.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon I have to generate a test for it, but with your test case, you now get:
* <a href="#11:31.55" id="11:31.55">11:31.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: roundup_admin.py -i demo exporttables foo
* <a href="#11:31.55" id="11:31.55">11:31.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Error in demo/extensions/config.ini with section [ldaplogin] at option userfilter: '%' must be followed by '%' or '(', found: '%s))'
* <a href="#11:37.01" id="11:37.01">11:37.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also did you folks write your own ldap integration module? I like being able to configure that from a config file. The ldap examples listed at <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/?action=fullsearch&context=180&value=ldap&titlesearch=Titles> are all configured in the python code.
* <a href="#11:39.37" id="11:39.37">11:39.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Is that something that you could contribute? Also why are the newuserroles set with the ldap config and not just inherited from the main config.ini new_web_user_roles?
* <a href="#12:06.26" id="12:06.26">12:06.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm here's a fun one. That error is only raised in python3. I wonder if interpolation is off for python2 and on for python3, or if python2 just doesn't detect it.
* <a href="#12:12.48" id="12:12.48">12:12.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: both are using basic interpolator so python2 version must not pick up on the error.
* <a href="#12:50.23" id="12:50.23">12:50.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: alright test done changes pushed. It's in CI now.
