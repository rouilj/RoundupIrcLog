# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-12-13
* <a href="#05:27.42" id="05:27.42">05:27.42 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: not sure if you remember, but a while back I had problem with python2 Long suffixes in my DB. You provided me with a patch to roundup/anypy/strings.py to be implemented before executing roundup-admin importtables. It worked really well.  Now I've setup a lab-VM and working my way through my migration documentation, and all of sudden importtables gives me a stack trace

* <a href="#08:44.15" id="08:44.15">08:44.15 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Ok its not just importtables, anything related to roundup-admin gives the same trace..
* <a href="#08:51.36" id="08:51.36">08:51.36 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: nvm. I had a malformed config.ini in extensions/ folder
* <a href="#08:53.39" id="08:53.39">08:53.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ack glad you found it. Do you have the contents of the malformed config.ini? That should give a better error message. Something like malformed line 22 in extensions/config.ini.
