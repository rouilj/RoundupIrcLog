# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-10-22
* <a href="#05:04.13" id="05:04.13">05:04.13 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: maintaining html/ between upgrades is a real pain.. any future plans for seperating local customisations from the code that roundup provides?
* <a href="#05:04.23" id="05:04.23">05:04.23 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I know Bugzilla has a form of hooks systems
* <a href="#20:22.52" id="20:22.52">20:22.52 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I have thought about it but there is no ticket for it. There are a few advantages to doing that.
* <a href="#20:23.12" id="20:23.12">20:23.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: For your current chore, the easiest way to do it is to diff the roundup provided template your tracker started with against the current template and apply it as a patch.
* <a href="#20:23.53" id="20:23.53">20:23.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you can also diff your trackers HTML against the original tracker version then apply that as a patch to the current tracker version.
* <a href="#20:24.25" id="20:24.25">20:24.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: In your case it's more difficult as you are moving forward across multiple releases.
* <a href="#20:29.09" id="20:29.09">20:29.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Going through the upgrading manual and applying the changes in order as needed is usually pretty easy. But it does get tedious if you have a bunch of accumulated changes.
* <a href="#20:34.09" id="20:34.09">20:34.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The template hooks in bugzilla can be emulated in roundup by defining a slot or macro and providing a local definition file for macros. I think jinja has an equivalent mechanism.
* <a href="#20:37.25" id="20:37.25">20:37.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: However IIRC Ito make it work, I had to make changes in the same files, but at least it localized the changes to the macros/slot definitions.
