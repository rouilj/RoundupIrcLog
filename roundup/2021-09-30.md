* <a href="#04:40.00" id="04:40.00">04:40.00 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Hello everyone! So im still in the process of migrating from 1.4.20 to 2.0. I'll soon start to look at the html/ templates. We have made some customisations on these over the years.. Is it worth trying to merge the changes from the newer versions found in /usr/share/roundup/templates/? I.e bugfixes and such
* <a href="#04:40.26" id="04:40.26">04:40.26 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: or is it totally fine to keep using our old 1.4.20 versions?
* <a href="#08:33.56" id="08:33.56">08:33.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi nomicon if you are going to python3, you must to merge.  Even if you are staying with python2 merging is suggested as there are  security changes to the templates in the 1.6 release that you want. Plus there is a mandatory login form change. Read the upgrading document for the details.
