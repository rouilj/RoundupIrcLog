* <a href="#10:24.05" id="10:24.05">10:24.05 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: rouilj: Maybe you shouldn't be doing it in an __init__?  Just have a factory function that returns the appropriate class after parsing the url?  Of course, it depends on exactly what you are trying to achieve.
* <a href="#10:24.58" id="10:24.58">10:24.58 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: s/appropriate class/an instance of the appropriate class/

* <a href="#11:37.30" id="11:37.30">11:37.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: bitdancer, I saw factory functions mentioned. I'll look into that pattern. I assume I will still need to write my own init for the two classes so I can pass in the parsed URL (and not have to redo it in init).

* <a href="#11:54.47" id="11:54.47">11:54.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: really need to refresh my knowledge on the gang of four pattern
* <a href="#11:54.53" id="11:54.53">11:54.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: patterns

* <a href="#13:21.22" id="13:21.22">13:21.22 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Probably two subclasses, yes, depending on what you want to do.  Gang of Four is instructive, but many of the patterns don't quite apply to Python (or rather Python makes them trivial?).  The other pattern to consider here is composition instead of inheritance: have your class with whatever public methods you need, have your init create the right kind of object after parsing the url,
* <a href="#13:21.24" id="13:21.24">13:21.24 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: assign that instance to an attribute, and then in your public method call methods of the created instance to do the real work.  Whether that is easier than factory + subclassing depends on exactly what interface your class is exposing.
* <a href="#13:23.12" id="13:23.12">13:23.12 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I say "factory function", but what that means in this context is just a function that parses the URL, decides which object to create, and then returns the object :)  It's pretty trivial, no real pattern knowwledge needed.
