* <a href="#08:09.05" id="08:09.05">08:09.05 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: As I think I've mentioned before, I've inherited a roundup installation.. this is all very new to me.. Im trying to find out what "external=True" means in this sense
* <a href="#08:09.13" id="08:09.13">08:09.13 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: |roundup-mailgw -S external=True /path/to/tracker
* <a href="#08:09.18" id="08:09.18">08:09.18 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: this is from a .procmailrc file
* <a href="#15:59.45" id="15:59.45">15:59.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon try man roundup-mailgw does that work?
* <a href="#16:00.29" id="16:00.29">16:00.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the man page should say something like:
* <a href="#16:00.31" id="16:00.31">16:00.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: -S property=value[;property=value] pairs
* <a href="#16:00.31" id="16:00.31">16:00.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: specify the values to set on the class specified by -C using the
* <a href="#16:00.31" id="16:00.31">16:00.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: same format as the Subject line property manipulations. Can also

* <a href="#16:01.22" id="16:01.22">16:01.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: my guess is that there is an option called external on the issue class. If the mail is processed by that line in the .procmailrc it sets the external flag/option to true.
* <a href="#16:02.05" id="16:02.05">16:02.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume that means that the issue was opened from an external user to the company. But that is just a guess on my part. Hopefully there is a comment in schema.py for the tracker explaing what external means.
