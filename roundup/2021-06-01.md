# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-01
* <a href="#03:42.15" id="03:42.15">03:42.15 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: thanks a lot for the info. I didn't realise that export/import is only supported for the same version, I'll need to rethink my plan.
* <a href="#03:42.44" id="03:42.44">03:42.44 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I'm moving from an ancient installation with 1.4 and postgres to a fresh installation with 2.0 and (probably) sqlite
* <a href="#03:44.07" id="03:44.07">03:44.07 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I guess that the -journals.csv files feed the "history" list visible on each item?
* <a href="#07:26.36" id="07:26.36">07:26.36 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: It does sound like we need to explicitly migrate.
* <a href="#07:26.43" id="07:26.43">07:26.43 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: sorry, mis-paste
* <a href="#11:03.39" id="11:03.39">11:03.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump: " guess that the -journals.csv files feed the "history" list visible on each item?" Correct. You can purge that if you want, but I like to keep it.
* <a href="#11:04.17" id="11:04.17">11:04.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Since you are changing back ends from postgres to sqlite yeah you have to export/import.
* <a href="#11:07.47" id="11:07.47">11:07.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You should be able to export with the 2.0.0 release (note the 20 year anniversary release: 2.1.0 is due mid july) and then import into sqlite with 2.0.0.
* <a href="#11:09.56" id="11:09.56">11:09.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you were using mysql there is a glitch in doing that because of a database encoding change, but since you aren't using mysql you don't need to worry about that. Not sure what nomicon's envirnment is though.
* <a href="#11:12.48" id="11:12.48">11:12.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think (but have not tried) export with 2.0.0 running under python 2. Import with the same. Then get all your code python3 compatible and remove your session and otks databases: (tracker_home/db/sessions and otks). Then fire up the tracker with python3.
* <a href="#11:13.21" id="11:13.21">11:13.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The gnu dbm's used for otks and sessions aren't readable by python3's dbm module for some reason I have forgotten.
* <a href="#11:15.31" id="11:15.31">11:15.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but the actual data in sqlite is fine. When you restart the server with python it should recreate the databases. At leastit does on my demo instance.
* <a href="#11:16.17" id="11:16.17">11:16.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: People will need to login again (if you are using native session logins).
* <a href="#11:17.39" id="11:17.39">11:17.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also Heffalump and nomicon can you tell me how long you have been using roundup? How many tickets and users you have. Also since you are upgrading I assume you are happy overall with roundup, but is there something that makes you go "hmm, it would be nice if....".
* <a href="#11:20.21" id="11:20.21">11:20.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, I am trying to find in the doc where it states that import/export should be used for the same version only. It is the reason that export is not recommended for backups: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/admin_guide.html#tracker-backup>
* <a href="#11:33.49" id="11:33.49">11:33.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I can't find that statement. For the 1.6.x -> 2.0.0 upgrade with mysql you actually have to export with 1.6 and import with 2.0 to account for the charset difference.
* <a href="#11:34.47" id="11:34.47">11:34.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I'll ask about that on the email list and see if anybody remebers using the same version for export/import.
* <a href="#11:36.18" id="11:36.18">11:36.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also heffalump. the problem with importing something ending in L (I assume long integer??) do you have a reference in python doc about that. If it is truely not needed, you could use sed or somethng to remove the L and try the import using 2.0.0 under python3 and see if it works.
