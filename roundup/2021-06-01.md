# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-01
* <a href="#03:42.15" id="03:42.15">03:42.15 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: thanks a lot for the info. I didn't realise that export/import is only supported for the same version, I'll need to rethink my plan.
* <a href="#03:42.44" id="03:42.44">03:42.44 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I'm moving from an ancient installation with 1.4 and postgres to a fresh installation with 2.0 and (probably) sqlite
* <a href="#03:44.07" id="03:44.07">03:44.07 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I guess that the -journals.csv files feed the "history" list visible on each item?
* <a href="#07:26.36" id="07:26.36">07:26.36 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: It does sound like we need to explicitly migrate.
* <a href="#07:26.43" id="07:26.43">07:26.43 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: sorry, mis-paste
* <a href="#11:03.39" id="11:03.39">11:03.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump: " guess that the -journals.csv files feed the "history" list visible on each item?" Correct. You can purge that if you want, but I like to keep it.
* <a href="#11:04.17" id="11:04.17">11:04.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Since you are changing back ends from postgres to sqlite yeah you have to export/import.
* <a href="#11:07.47" id="11:07.47">11:07.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You should be able to export with the 2.0.0 release (note the 20 year anniversary release: 2.1.0 is due mid july) and then import into sqlite with 2.0.0.
* <a href="#11:09.56" id="11:09.56">11:09.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you were using mysql there is a glitch in doing that because of a database encoding change, but since you aren't using mysql you don't need to worry about that. Not sure what nomicon's envirnment is though.
* <a href="#11:12.48" id="11:12.48">11:12.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think (but have not tried) export with 2.0.0 running under python 2. Import with the same. Then get all your code python3 compatible and remove your session and otks databases: (tracker_home/db/sessions and otks). Then fire up the tracker with python3.
* <a href="#11:13.21" id="11:13.21">11:13.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The gnu dbm's used for otks and sessions aren't readable by python3's dbm module for some reason I have forgotten.
* <a href="#11:15.31" id="11:15.31">11:15.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but the actual data in sqlite is fine. When you restart the server with python it should recreate the databases. At leastit does on my demo instance.
* <a href="#11:16.17" id="11:16.17">11:16.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: People will need to login again (if you are using native session logins).
* <a href="#11:17.39" id="11:17.39">11:17.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also Heffalump and nomicon can you tell me how long you have been using roundup? How many tickets and users you have. Also since you are upgrading I assume you are happy overall with roundup, but is there something that makes you go "hmm, it would be nice if....".
* <a href="#11:20.21" id="11:20.21">11:20.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, I am trying to find in the doc where it states that import/export should be used for the same version only. It is the reason that export is not recommended for backups: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/admin_guide.html#tracker-backup>
* <a href="#11:33.49" id="11:33.49">11:33.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I can't find that statement. For the 1.6.x -> 2.0.0 upgrade with mysql you actually have to export with 1.6 and import with 2.0 to account for the charset difference.
* <a href="#11:34.47" id="11:34.47">11:34.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I'll ask about that on the email list and see if anybody remebers using the same version for export/import.
* <a href="#11:36.18" id="11:36.18">11:36.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also heffalump. the problem with importing something ending in L (I assume long integer??) do you have a reference in python doc about that. If it is truely not needed, you could use sed or somethng to remove the L and try the import using 2.0.0 under python3 and see if it works.
* <a href="#12:35.18" id="12:35.18">12:35.18 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: I see, thanks. It hadn't even occurred to me before you mentioned it that the export format is not stable.
* <a href="#12:35.49" id="12:35.49">12:35.49 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I think I'll need to get both 1.4 and 2.0 running in one place to do that migration (and perhaps intermediate versions to smooth the path?)
* <a href="#12:37.07" id="12:37.07">12:37.07 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: our roundup instance is 10-15 years old: <http://bugs.darcs.net> - about 5000 bugs/patches. Lots of users over time (plus spammers) but only a few active developers now.
* <a href="#12:37.23" id="12:37.23">12:37.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: it's hosted on a pretty old machine that is overdue for replacement, hence the activity to migrate now
* <a href="#12:40.16" id="12:40.16">12:40.16 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: oh cool. I didn;t realize you were darcs.
* <a href="#12:41.26" id="12:41.26">12:41.26 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I guess in an ideal world we would actually build something to track issues into our own hosting platform, so we could integrate better with the VCS itself, but roundup has been pretty good at doing everything short of that, I really like its simplicity.
* <a href="#12:41.31" id="12:41.31">12:41.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: let me know how it goes. Also so far nobody is supporting my statement that export/import is not supposed to work across versions.
* <a href="#12:41.48" id="12:41.48">12:41.48 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I see - so it's possible it might work, but I shouldn't count on it?
* <a href="#12:42.11" id="12:42.11">12:42.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: That's a fair statement I think given your experience.
* <a href="#12:43.01" id="12:43.01">12:43.01 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I think I need to look much more closely at our schema customisations and make sure they are all applied to the new default schema before I draw any very definite conclusions about what works.
* <a href="#12:43.52" id="12:43.52">12:43.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: Re your point about removing the 'L' - that did occur to me but I also got nervous that the python2->python3 upgrade would be one more level of complexity to manage all at once. My main goal right now is to get this migration done as quickly as possible without losing data or functionality.
* <a href="#12:44.00" id="12:44.00">12:44.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: What was sugested on roundup-users was export/import using 1.4/2.0.0 with python2 then convert to python3.  Note the need to delete the anydbm databases as noted above.
* <a href="#12:44.25" id="12:44.25">12:44.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: understood on your main goal.
* <a href="#12:44.52" id="12:44.52">12:44.52 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also pay attention to upgrading.txt as well. There are a few changes.
* <a href="#12:45.12" id="12:45.12">12:45.12 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: thanks - will pay attention to the anydbm databases and upgrading.txt
* <a href="#12:46.16" id="12:46.16">12:46.16 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I have edited csv output converting a number value to the new integer type. So exported with old schema, changed number -> integer and imported. Everything worked fine.
* <a href="#14:22.17" id="14:22.17">14:22.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hello bfrk did you have a question?
* <a href="#14:22.52" id="14:22.52">14:22.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: bfrk is another darcs developer
* <a href="#14:23.04" id="14:23.04">14:23.04 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, you mentioned a lot of custom code in your tracker. What does it do? WE may have something already in python3 tht will work?
* <a href="#14:23.14" id="14:23.14">14:23.14 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump ack thx.
* <a href="#14:24.46" id="14:24.46">14:24.46 (EDT)</a> - __[bfrk](https://github.com/bfrk)__: Hi, no concrete question ATM, lurking in case something comes up wrt our migration
* <a href="#14:39.37" id="14:39.37">14:39.37 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Happy lurking. Note that I am the primary resource on this channel. Taggnostr handles roundup for bugs.python.org but he hasn't worked with 2.0 at all.
* <a href="#14:39.48" id="14:39.48">14:39.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Im UTC-5
* <a href="#14:40.37" id="14:40.37">14:40.37 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and on/off chat. I do have a bouncer and check the log (user loggymclogface is the logger), so ask and I will respond when I can.
* <a href="#15:04.59" id="15:04.59">15:04.59 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: thanks a lot for all the advice so far. I will do more experiments and no doubt be back with more questions.
