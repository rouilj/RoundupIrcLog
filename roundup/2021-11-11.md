* <a href="#01:54.40" id="01:54.40">01:54.40 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: Thank you for your answers on the list. I've not yet found time to check it out, but I will for sure. This just makes me wonder, Am I the only one who stumbled upon this problem, or shouldn't this happen to everyone who goes from python2->python3 and using pgsql ?
* <a href="#17:13.30" id="17:13.30">17:13.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomiccon, yes it should happen for everybody with any back end that has a long int. I think postgres's int is a long int. My guess is: 1) most people upgraded stayed with python2 planning on python3 conversion later. 2) most people don't have long int's in their schema that are encoded with the L. I have a number of test trackers and tried dumping the 2 I have under python2. No L in the output. However dumping issue.roundup-tracke
* <a href="#17:13.30" id="17:13.30">17:13.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s status using postgres as a back end shows the issue:

* <a href="#17:22.16" id="17:22.16">17:22.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The 2-3 conversion has only been done a few times AFAIK. I don't remember what backends were used, however I suspect any rdbms backend except possibly mysql would be affected. Mysql max int is 2147483647 which is 2^31-1 and less than sys.maxint on python2. If the fix I gave you works, I am going to see if I can figure out how to test that code. Also I want to try to write up a converter that can be run to strip the L from entries
* <a href="#17:22.16" id="17:22.16">17:22.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: database without a dump/restore cycle.
* <a href="#17:24.44" id="17:24.44">17:24.44 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I see things like:
* <a href="#17:24.46" id="17:24.46">17:24.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ('issue', '2550490', 'status')
* <a href="#17:24.46" id="17:24.46">17:24.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ('issue', 2550491L, 'status')
* <a href="#17:24.46" id="17:24.46">17:24.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 
* <a href="#17:25.35" id="17:25.35">17:25.35 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: i.e. the second value of param is a string or an int. It looks like links save the value as an int and unlink saves the value as a char.
* <a href="#17:25.41" id="17:25.41">17:25.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well string.
* <a href="#17:26.15" id="17:26.15">17:26.15 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: since that second element is an id, it should be a string (all id's are strings internally).
* <a href="#17:28.20" id="17:28.20">17:28.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: this looks like a bug in the encoding. The entities above are from 2009, so I am guessing it was a bug that was fixed as similar entries from 2021 report:
* <a href="#17:28.21" id="17:28.21">17:28.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 6 | 2021-11-07 06:11:25.615 | 40  | link   | ('issue', '2551167', 'status')
* <a href="#17:28.21" id="17:28.21">17:28.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 1 | 2021-11-07 06:11:25.605 | 40  | unlink | ('issue', '2551167', 'status')
* <a href="#17:28.28" id="17:28.28">17:28.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: note both strings.
* <a href="#17:29.54" id="17:29.54">17:29.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr see above. Have you seen this? If so did you tell me and I forgot about it?
* <a href="#17:37.27" id="17:37.27">17:37.27 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, given this new bit of info (L form seems to be a bug and isn't generated anymore) maybe there is no need to covert the data in the database as it will only affect old bugs which presumably aren't accessed often.
* <a href="#17:55.05" id="17:55.05">17:55.05 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Been groveling through the code trying to figure out when the change occurred. No luck 8-(.
* <a href="#18:00.54" id="18:00.54">18:00.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that also explains why I don't see this in any of my test trackers. They are fixed to put out id's as string and not integers 8-(.
