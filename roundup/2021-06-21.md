# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-21
* <a href="#07:41.08" id="07:41.08">07:41.08 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: hi @rouilj ideally this would be applied by opening a Pull Request to edit <https://github.com/python/psf-salt/blob/master/salt/bugs/config/nginx.conf.jinja>
* <a href="#10:09.09" id="10:09.09">10:09.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin,  I want to try it on roundup first before I change other configs. Esp. cpython. In case it doesn't work or causes issues.
* <a href="#10:09.33" id="10:09.33">10:09.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If it tests out there, then yup it goes in as a pull request.
* <a href="#10:35.17" id="10:35.17">10:35.17 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: rouilj: you can open the PR and i'll temporarily apply it for test. just want to know what configuration you intend explicitly
* <a href="#10:46.52" id="10:46.52">10:46.52 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: fair enough.
* <a href="#10:56.01" id="10:56.01">10:56.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: pull request sent
* <a href="#10:57.39" id="10:57.39">10:57.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: btw all 2.1.0b1 was released saturday. If you are upgrading consider testing with it. I expect 2.1.0 in mid july barring showstoppers.
* <a href="#11:01.54" id="11:01.54">11:01.54 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: rouilj: thanks for the PR i'll review this afternoon.
* <a href="#13:11.20" id="13:11.20">13:11.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin ack. I'll be in and out this afternoon.
* <a href="#15:35.24" id="15:35.24">15:35.24 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: rouilj: applied to all trackers we host.
* <a href="#15:35.32" id="15:35.32">15:35.32 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: thank you!
* <a href="#15:43.09" id="15:43.09">15:43.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you're welcome looks like compression is working. Just to be sure, I know nginx is the last proxy before gnuicorn, but is there a caching proxy in front of nginx? If so I think we need the gzip_vary header?
* <a href="#15:43.21" id="15:43.21">15:43.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin see above just to be sure.
* <a href="#15:43.23" id="15:43.23">15:43.23 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: no caching in the haproxy layer
* <a href="#15:43.31" id="15:43.31">15:43.31 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: so it's all good
* <a href="#15:43.35" id="15:43.35">15:43.35 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: gotcha. Good.
* <a href="#15:44.03" id="15:44.03">15:44.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thanks. Time to return some scanners to see how we score now.
* <a href="#15:49.12" id="15:49.12">15:49.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yea lighthouse reports 100% on performance high 80's on accessibility and SEO and low 90's on best practices.
* <a href="#15:56.05" id="15:56.05">15:56.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: webpagetest gives all A except for caching. EWDurbin any idea why css and js are only cached for 1 hour? Does anybody running there make changes often enough to require that low cache time?
* <a href="#16:28.34" id="16:28.34">16:28.34 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: rouilj: <https://github.com/python/psf-salt/blob/630182f8a8419460f23a7b68e8ba2cc86bac5401/salt/bugs/config/nginx.conf.jinja#L66>
* <a href="#16:28.37" id="16:28.37">16:28.37 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: is why it's an hour
* <a href="#16:28.47" id="16:28.47">16:28.47 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: i think i just plucked that from air
* <a href="#16:30.01" id="16:30.01">16:30.01 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: since as far as i'm aware css/js aren't cache bustable (in other words their name doesn't change when they're modified) i don't think it's wise to push that much further
* <a href="#19:00.56" id="19:00.56">19:00.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah without changing the name (which can be done) there is no great way to cache bust. The query param trick (style.css?v=2) doesn't always work at browser level and IIRC never did for squid etc. (since we have no upstream proxies this case doesn't matter for us).
* <a href="#19:01.24" id="19:01.24">19:01.24 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin thanks for the info.
* <a href="#19:08.22" id="19:08.22">19:08.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also bummer that nginx doesn't support brotli compression.
