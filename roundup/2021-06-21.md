* <a href="#07:41.08" id="07:41.08">07:41.08 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: hi @rouilj ideally this would be applied by opening a Pull Request to edit <https://github.com/python/psf-salt/blob/master/salt/bugs/config/nginx.conf.jinja>
* <a href="#10:09.09" id="10:09.09">10:09.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin,  I want to try it on roundup first before I change other configs. Esp. cpython. In case it doesn't work or causes issues.
* <a href="#10:09.33" id="10:09.33">10:09.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If it tests out there, then yup it goes in as a pull request.
