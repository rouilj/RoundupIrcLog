* <a href="#17:12.01" id="17:12.01">17:12.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I assume you are running roundup 2.0. Are you using python3? If so which version?
* <a href="#17:13.33" id="17:13.33">17:13.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also @@file/style.css is the correct path to load the style.css file from the html directory.
