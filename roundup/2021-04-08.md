# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-04-08
* <a href="#04:38.08" id="04:38.08">04:38.08 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj I'll try to remember to have a look tonight. Give me a ping in a couple of days if you haven't heard anything.
* <a href="#04:39.27" id="04:39.27">04:39.27 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: Might be something on the Travis side of things. Sounds like since they got bought out a few years ago thing a have been steadily going down hill.
* <a href="#04:40.14" id="04:40.14">04:40.14 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I haven't really been paying much attention because I mostly use GitLab CI these days.
* <a href="#07:52.39" id="07:52.39">07:52.39 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: I suspect the TravisCI problems are related to the shutdown of travis.org <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/migrate/open-source-repository-migration#frequently-asked-questions>
* <a href="#08:12.30" id="08:12.30">08:12.30 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I've migrated the build across to travis-ci.com (I think): <https://travis-ci.com/github/roundup-tracker/roundup>
* <a href="#09:22.00" id="09:22.00">09:22.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerykan[m] yes I think the shutdown is the issue and I wasn't able to migrate anything. How did you do it? Maybe I needed owner acess or some other permission?
* <a href="#09:26.13" id="09:26.13">09:26.13 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I finally got it migrated after a lot of messing around. The default TravisCI workflow seemed to assume I wanted to work with personal repositories instead of a organisation one. Can't remember what exactly it did to get it to pick up the Roundup organisation.
* <a href="#09:26.55" id="09:26.55">09:26.55 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I believe owners(?) of the Roundup organisation should have access to the settings in TravisCI. If not, let me know and I'll have a look.
* <a href="#09:37.45" id="09:37.45">09:37.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: YEah that was the same issue I had. I could only see my personal repos. Not roundup-tracker's repos.
* <a href="#09:43.19" id="09:43.19">09:43.19 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Looks like commits are running again. I am not sure how to tell if I am an owner or not.
* <a href="#09:47.39" id="09:47.39">09:47.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am listed under manage users in the settings tab. but It doesn't look like I can add users.
* <a href="#18:55.46" id="18:55.46">18:55.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] did you get a chance to respond to <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/msg7169> on the changeover to setupttols from distutils? I don't see a response on ticket but I've had email updates go on walkabout occassionally in the past.
* <a href="#19:51.39" id="19:51.39">19:51.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hi loggy
* <a href="#19:54.05" id="19:54.05">19:54.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and loggy is back.
* <a href="#19:58.05" id="19:58.05">19:58.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmmph.
* <a href="#19:59.55" id="19:59.55">19:59.55 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: <rouilj "jerrykan ack. Have a great rest "> Thanks
