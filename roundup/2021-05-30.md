# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-05-30
* <a href="#11:44.58" id="11:44.58">11:44.58 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: is there a high-level description of what the -journals.csv files in a roundup export are for? Context is that I'm trying to upgrade from roundup 1.4 to 2.0, which I appreciate might be painful! One hurdle is that the -journals files contain a bunch of fields like 850L where other rows have a quoted number like '868'
* <a href="#11:45.19" id="11:45.19">11:45.19 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: and I get an "invalid syntax" error on import
* <a href="#15:56.27" id="15:56.27">15:56.27 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: ok, that problem seems likely to be a python2/python3 issue, as a trailing 'L' for literals stopped being supported in python 3. With python 2 I get a different error.
