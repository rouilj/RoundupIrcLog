* <a href="#08:29.40" id="08:29.40">08:29.40 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: "Many of the .html and .py files from Roundup that are copied into tracker directories have changed for Python 3 support. If you wish to move an existing tracker to Python 3, you need to merge in those changes."
* <a href="#08:30.12" id="08:30.12">08:30.12 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Any more info on where I could find what those changes are?
