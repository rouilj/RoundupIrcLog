# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-01-03
* <a href="#05:51.53" id="05:51.53">05:51.53 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: yeah the mail gets delivered to the tracker. I beleive filesystem is xfs (unable to check right now). Yeah logrotate will be setup accordingly later on, this is still just in staging environment. db is postgres. Log filename is roundup.log, so its not really long =)
* <a href="#05:52.36" id="05:52.36">05:52.36 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: so you are saying that its probably something outside of roundup ecosystem that makes the mailgw crash?
* <a href="#09:30.14" id="09:30.14">09:30.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: given the info we have I would say yes.
* <a href="#09:30.20" id="09:30.20">09:30.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon prior for you
* <a href="#09:38.09" id="09:38.09">09:38.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it looks like it's trapping an error from the system. error code 27 is EFBIG according to mydocs. Google did turn up a report of EFBIG being returned for too many files in a directory.
* <a href="#09:38.33" id="09:38.33">09:38.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so that may be another avenue of investigation.
* <a href="#09:39.47" id="09:39.47">09:39.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: man 2 write reports:
* <a href="#09:39.48" id="09:39.48">09:39.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EFBIG An attempt was made to write a file that exceeds the  implementation-defined maximum file size or the process's file size  limit, or to write at a position past the maximum allowed offset.
