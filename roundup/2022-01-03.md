# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-01-03
* <a href="#05:51.53" id="05:51.53">05:51.53 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: yeah the mail gets delivered to the tracker. I beleive filesystem is xfs (unable to check right now). Yeah logrotate will be setup accordingly later on, this is still just in staging environment. db is postgres. Log filename is roundup.log, so its not really long =)
* <a href="#05:52.36" id="05:52.36">05:52.36 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: so you are saying that its probably something outside of roundup ecosystem that makes the mailgw crash?
