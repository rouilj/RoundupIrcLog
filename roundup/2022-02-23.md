* <a href="#02:10.12" id="02:10.12">02:10.12 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: That error was just because I was using roundup as 'root' user instead of 'roundup' user
* <a href="#02:14.44" id="02:14.44">02:14.44 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: the original error I was trying to debug was a Permission error in the roundup.log which was caused by wrong SELinux label on the mailgw executeble after upgrade from 2.0.0 to 2.1.0
