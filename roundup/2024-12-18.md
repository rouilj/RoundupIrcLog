* <a href="#09:08.46" id="09:08.46">09:08.46 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: does anyone know if there's a good way to upgrade from roundup 1.4.4 to current or near current?
* <a href="#09:09.37" id="09:09.37">09:09.37 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: or will i be stuck performing several migration steps detailed in <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading-history.html> ?

* <a href="#11:08.28" id="11:08.28">11:08.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi randy_. You will need to follow the steps in upgrading. However you should be able to do it in two or three versions of Roundup.

* <a href="#11:09.31" id="11:09.31">11:09.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I suggest upgrading to he latest 1.x version 1.6.1 first and testing with it an do all the upgrading-history and upgrading steps that are needed.

* <a href="#11:10.47" id="11:10.47">11:10.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: then install/upgrade to 2.0 and perform the upgrading steps. The big lift for this one will be getting your locally written code able to run under python3.

* <a href="#11:11.06" id="11:11.06">11:11.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Then running python3, upgrade to 2.4.0 and perform the upgrading steps.
