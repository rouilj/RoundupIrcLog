* <a href="#09:08.03" id="09:08.03">09:08.03 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: roundup gang

* <a href="#09:08.46" id="09:08.46">09:08.46 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: does anyone know if there's a good way to upgrade from roundup 1.4.4 to current or near current?
* <a href="#09:09.37" id="09:09.37">09:09.37 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: or will i be stuck performing several migration steps detailed in <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading-history.html> ?

* <a href="#11:08.28" id="11:08.28">11:08.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi randy_. You will need to follow the steps in upgrading. However you should be able to do it in two or three versions of Roundup.

* <a href="#11:09.31" id="11:09.31">11:09.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I suggest upgrading to he latest 1.x version 1.6.1 first and testing with it an do all the upgrading-history and upgrading steps that are needed.

* <a href="#11:10.47" id="11:10.47">11:10.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: then install/upgrade to 2.0 and perform the upgrading steps. The big lift for this one will be getting your locally written code able to run under python3.

* <a href="#11:11.06" id="11:11.06">11:11.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Then running python3, upgrade to 2.4.0 and perform the upgrading steps.

* <a href="#11:13.08" id="11:13.08">11:13.08 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think 1.4.4 is the oldest one I have seen being upgraded. It's from early 2008.

* <a href="#11:15.11" id="11:15.11">11:15.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: While I have worked with Roundup since it's inception in 2001, I haven't tried updating anything that old. The oldest I had a hand in upgrading was a 1.5 ish system.
* <a href="#11:15.34" id="11:15.34">11:15.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also randy_ what database backend are you using?

* <a href="#11:29.09" id="11:29.09">11:29.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You might need some updates to the backend if you are using mysql.

* <a href="#11:32.21" id="11:32.21">11:32.21 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also newer upgrade instructions include markers like required, recommended etc. Technically only the required have to be done, but you want to do the recommended steps as well. I'll check back for your responses during the day.

* <a href="#11:38.48" id="11:38.48">11:38.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also randy_, I am interested in what you are using roundup for. I assume it has been meeting your needs all these years and that you/your company never saw a need to upgrade. So what drove the upgrade requirement now: security, modern python, features (which ones)? Even if you don't answer the survey you can still get help here 8-).

* <a href="#11:50.51" id="11:50.51">11:50.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also randy_ you can check the irc logs for info. <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/fossil/roundup_irc_logs/doc/trunk/log/roundup/2023-05-03.md> shows nomicon going from 1.4.21 to 1.5.1 in one pass. Hefalump <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/fossil/roundup_irc_logs/doc/trunk/log/roundup/2021-06-01.md> also did an upgrade spanning multiple versions. So reading around that time period could be useful. Also searching for 'upgrade' will get
* <a href="#11:50.51" id="11:50.51">11:50.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hits that could be worth following.

* <a href="#12:49.46" id="12:49.46">12:49.46 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: hey rouilj thanks for getting back to me. i'll try following the steps to go from 1.4.4 to 1.6.1, and then to 2.0, and then 2.4.
* <a href="#12:50.26" id="12:50.26">12:50.26 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: believe the DB is MS sql from the same era

* <a href="#12:51.56" id="12:51.56">12:51.56 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: some of my org's devs have been using issue tracker for bug tracking and issue tickets. it's currently on an old windows server 2008 box, and we're trying to get the application and db migrated to new DB versions and host OS'
* <a href="#12:52.44" id="12:52.44">12:52.44 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: no one who set this up is here anymore and no one seems to know how it works. so i'm taking a crack at it so we can retire these old hosts

* <a href="#12:56.14" id="12:56.14">12:56.14 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: and yeah, the people using issuetracker at my org love it and use it all the time. they just clearly aren't updating it all the time ;)

* <a href="#12:57.34" id="12:57.34">12:57.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ I don't believe we ever had support for  MS SQL. If you have support, it must be something home grown. We don't support it now. So that's your first big issue.

* <a href="#12:59.58" id="12:59.58">12:59.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: for 1.4.4 it looks like sqlite, postgresql, mysql and anydbm were all supported. So same as today. If you do have MS-SQL support, I would like to see it.

* <a href="#13:00.43" id="13:00.43">13:00.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I'm not sure we could make it supported, but it might be interesting for somebody who can support it to get from the wiki.

* <a href="#13:02.23" id="13:02.23">13:02.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Cloning the working tracker to a new system, then upgrading on the new system is the way I would go.

* <a href="#13:03.34" id="13:03.34">13:03.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: However, rather than migrating, would spinning up a new system and using the existing system in archive only mode be an option?

* <a href="#13:04.56" id="13:04.56">13:04.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If older info in the tracker is unused/unreferenced anywhere that might be an easier option. then virtualize the existing 2008 system.

* <a href="#13:05.46" id="13:05.46">13:05.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: or if licensing is an issue, migrate it as in an archive mode to a newer windows server.

* <a href="#13:07.24" id="13:07.24">13:07.24 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah that's what someone's already tried - migrating to a fresh host with a new fresh server OS. i'm not sure how they migrated the DB yet. so that's the path i'm continuing to mess with.
* <a href="#13:07.40" id="13:07.40">13:07.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: got it.
* <a href="#13:07.57" id="13:07.57">13:07.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah the db could be ... ticklish
* <a href="#13:07.59" id="13:07.59">13:07.59 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the only reason i'm saying it's running on MS SQL is because the config.ini is pointing to a server with MS SQL on it. and as far i can tell that's the only DB software running on that server

* <a href="#13:08.28" id="13:08.28">13:08.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: interesting.

* <a href="#13:09.49" id="13:09.49">13:09.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: does netstat -an on the database server show port 5432 (postgres) or 3306 (mysql) open?

* <a href="#13:10.55" id="13:10.55">13:10.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If all you see is port 1433 then yeah that's mssql.

* <a href="#13:13.52" id="13:13.52">13:13.52 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: "However, rather than migrating, would spinning up a new system and using the existing system in archive only mode be an option?" probably not. if i did this, there wouldn't be a wait to upheave the ticket objects from the old system to the new one, right? that's what the DB migration would be for
* <a href="#13:14.15" id="13:14.15">13:14.15 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: yeah lot of 1433 established. no 3306 or 5432

* <a href="#13:15.53" id="13:15.53">13:15.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ not just established, look for open listeners *.*. You would only see a database connection if somebody was using roundup at the time you ran netstat. You probably have a bunch of other apps or msql connection poolers for other services that would have open connections.

* <a href="#13:20.26" id="13:20.26">13:20.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "there wouldn't be a wait to upheave the ticket objects from the old system to the new one"
* <a href="#13:20.27" id="13:20.27">13:20.27 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: True you would leave all the existing data/ticket objects where they are. So you would need to keep the backend database server in place (or change backends to sqlite so you don't need a running db server). Not sure that a backend change is technically an option in your situation.

* <a href="#13:22.38" id="13:22.38">13:22.38 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also by default Roundup stores "blob" data - attached files, message bodies etc. in the filesystem under the tracker's db directory. It does not store this data in the database. So there are two places parts of "ticket objects" are stored.
