* <a href="#20:38.51" id="20:38.51">20:38.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr have you been in touch with your 2019 GSOC student who did the oic/openid implementation for roundup? I am trying to set up issues.roundup-tracker.org (iro) with github login and came across his blog. He had a few issues with docs that I wanted to clean up. Also was hoping I could co-op him into helping me get the basic code into roundup proper.
