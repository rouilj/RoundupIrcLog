* <a href="#13:14.57" id="13:14.57">13:14.57 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: hey gang. i'm back at the issue tracker again. i'm trying to setup a new install on python 3.13.1, on windows server 2025. i've filled out the minimum requirements in config.ini. i've initialized my tracker. but when i go to run it with roundup-server, i get "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat'. any ideas?

* <a href="#13:16.16" id="13:16.16">13:16.16 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i tried / slahes and \ slashes i my tracker path, i tried using double slashes, tried using quotes, all yield the same "module 'ntpath' has no attribute 'stat"

* <a href="#18:13.00" id="18:13.00">18:13.00 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: randy_: what happens if you just run python from the command line, import os, and type 'os.stat'?  It looks like ntpath lots the 'stat' attribute as of python 3.13, and I don't know if that is a bug in python or not.  I'd think not, but I could be wrong ;)

* <a href="#18:59.13" id="18:59.13">18:59.13 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: <https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#querying-file-type-and-status> indicates that stat should be valid for pathtype objects.

* <a href="#18:59.43" id="18:59.43">18:59.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: Does it give any line numbers in the roundup source code for reference?
