* <a href="#01:38.22" id="01:38.22">01:38.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You can configure it for additional functionality. The classic interface is basic by design. You may want to look at the responsive or devel templates. If you have jinja2 instaled you can look at the jinja2 template. That also supports formating using markdown. If you are interested in that template you probably want to join the roundup-users mailing list.
* <a href="#01:39.29" id="01:39.29">01:39.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: To see some examples of other trackers you can visit: <https://bugs.python.org>/ or my sysadmin tracker at <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo>/
* <a href="#01:41.29" id="01:41.29">01:41.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Because the use cases for roundup are so different, help desk, bug tracker, paper submission system, consulting work tracker (with time tracking), even a GTD system, we don't supply a tracker definition for every use case. The user gets to define that with the features they need.
* <a href="#01:42.48" id="01:42.48">01:42.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Have you looked at the customizing roundup examples in the documentation? You can find the docs at <https://www.roundup-tracker.org>.
