# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-05-01
* <a href="#01:04.42" id="01:04.42">01:04.42 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc18845](https://github.com/qwebirc18845)__: hello
* <a href="#01:04.46" id="01:04.46">01:04.46 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc18845](https://github.com/qwebirc18845)__: anyone here?
* <a href="#01:38.22" id="01:38.22">01:38.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You can configure it for additional functionality. The classic interface is basic by design. You may want to look at the responsive or devel templates. If you have jinja2 instaled you can look at the jinja2 template. That also supports formating using markdown. If you are interested in that template you probably want to join the roundup-users mailing list.
* <a href="#01:39.29" id="01:39.29">01:39.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: To see some examples of other trackers you can visit: <https://bugs.python.org>/ or my sysadmin tracker at <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo>/
* <a href="#01:41.29" id="01:41.29">01:41.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Because the use cases for roundup are so different, help desk, bug tracker, paper submission system, consulting work tracker (with time tracking), even a GTD system, we don't supply a tracker definition for every use case. The user gets to define that with the features they need.
* <a href="#01:42.48" id="01:42.48">01:42.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Have you looked at the customizing roundup examples in the documentation? You can find the docs at <https://www.roundup-tracker.org>.
* <a href="#01:43.34" id="01:43.34">01:43.34 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc18845 above for you.
* <a href="#01:49.11" id="01:49.11">01:49.11 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc18845](https://github.com/qwebirc18845)__: can someone install it for me as i am not a technical person
* <a href="#01:49.23" id="01:49.23">01:49.23 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc18845](https://github.com/qwebirc18845)__: does anyone here provide that assistance
* <a href="#02:02.50" id="02:02.50">02:02.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't have the time to do a contract at this time. It doesn't look like anybody else signed up to be a RoundupConsultant on the wiki. I know there are a couple of people that do that on the roundup-users list. I don't know what their availability is.
* <a href="#02:03.18" id="02:03.18">02:03.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: What is your use case?
* <a href="#02:05.39" id="02:05.39">02:05.39 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc18845](https://github.com/qwebirc18845)__: i need customisation works done after the initial setup but the ticketing system looks very good
* <a href="#02:05.53" id="02:05.53">02:05.53 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc18845](https://github.com/qwebirc18845)__: can someone contact me on whatsapp?
* <a href="#02:08.26" id="02:08.26">02:08.26 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Best if you make your request on the roundup-users mailing list. Explain your use case and what customization you want. At least one of the contractors I am thinking of is in germany, so he may very well use whatsapp.
* <a href="#02:10.03" id="02:10.03">02:10.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: afk very late where I am. Have a good night.
