# Roundup IRC Log for 2024-04-02
* <a href="#09:46.51" id="09:46.51">09:46.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin, Taggnostr any idea why email to the trackers seems offline? One of the Roundup contributers reported: <issues@roundup-tracker.org>: host bugs.python.org[167.71.181.142] said: 454     4.7.1 <issues@roundup-tracker.org>: Relay access denied (in reply to RCPT     TO command) happened sometime on Monday. Did anything change there?

* <a href="#11:16.55" id="11:16.55">11:16.55 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: @rouilj hm, if anything changed with that it would have been when the host was migrated to 22.04 back in January: <https://github.com/python/psf-salt/issues/346>
* <a href="#11:17.15" id="11:17.15">11:17.15 (EDT)</a> - __[EWDurbin](https://github.com/EWDurbin)__: i don't recall how the gateway was setup before, will have to investigate and see what can be done.

* <a href="#13:14.39" id="13:14.39">13:14.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin, My guess is that roundup-tracker.org isn't recognized by postfix as a local delivery address. The last email that I sent was in november 2023, pre upgrade. I apparently forgot to test email when I was checking everything else.

* <a href="#13:18.15" id="13:18.15">13:18.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: This line in /etc/postfix/main.cf looks off:
* <a href="#13:18.18" id="13:18.18">13:18.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: mydestination = $myhostname, bugs.nyc1.psf.io, localhost.nyc1.psf.io, , localhost

* <a href="#13:23.09" id="13:23.09">13:23.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I would expect it to include roundup-tracker.org. However I don't find any indication that roundup-mailgw is called from the postfix config. Isn't the config for that box under a github repo somewhere?

* <a href="#13:24.45" id="13:24.45">13:24.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The term virtual domain is popping into my head when I think about this. Not sure it's the right term though....

* <a href="#13:28.55" id="13:28.55">13:28.55 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: found it. I think: <https://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html#virtual_alias> is what you want. Don't change mydestination.

* <a href="#13:44.02" id="13:44.02">13:44.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Been literally over a decade since I had to configure postfix. Kind of happy I came up with the virtual alias/address term. Also see: <https://www.postfix.org/VIRTUAL_README.html#mailing_lists>. Apparently the mapping is: virtual address: issues@roundup-tracker.org: roundup_issue_tracker; then in /etc/aliases you put:
* <a href="#13:44.02" id="13:44.02">13:44.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: roundup_issue_tracker:  /srv/roundup/env/bin/roundup-mailgw /srv/roundup/trackers/roundup

* <a href="#13:46.24" id="13:46.24">13:46.24 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: let me know if I can be of help.
