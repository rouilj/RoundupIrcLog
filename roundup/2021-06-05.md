# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-05
* <a href="#16:49.09" id="16:49.09">16:49.09 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I'm now feeling a bit more stuck on importing the csv export. I've gone back to roundup 1.4.15, which is the version we have in production, and copied our exact schema too, and even then I can't import:
* <a href="#16:49.18" id="16:49.18">16:49.18 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: IntegrityError: UNIQUE constraint failed: _user.__retired__, _user._username
* <a href="#16:50.07" id="16:50.07">16:50.07 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: which, as an error, seems justified, as we do have duplicate usernames in our users database, as it seems possible to reuse a username after it has been retired, then re-retire the new one.
* <a href="#16:50.21" id="16:50.21">16:50.21 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: but then why were we able to get into this state to begin with?
* <a href="#16:51.08" id="16:51.08">16:51.08 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: the only difference now is that the export is from postgres and I'm importing into sqlite; I'll try importing into postgres too next. But that would be pretty annoying if we were constrained to postgres by our data.
* <a href="#16:51.27" id="16:51.27">16:51.27 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I also need to investigate whether all these duplicates are actually spammers and maybe we should just filter them out when we import.
* <a href="#16:52.12" id="16:52.12">16:52.12 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: btw I really appreciate your help and feedback here, but if you think I should just try the mailing list directly, let me know.
* <a href="#17:00.28" id="17:00.28">17:00.28 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: no, some of the duplicates are genine users
* <a href="#17:00.32" id="17:00.32">17:00.32 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: *genuine
* <a href="#17:24.49" id="17:24.49">17:24.49 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: my next idea is just to munge the CSV file to rename the retired ones if needed
* <a href="#18:01.58" id="18:01.58">18:01.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi Heffalump. That's umm interesting. Could you bring this up on the mailing list. I think editing the username for retired users to make them unique should work. But yeah you shouldn't get into that state to begin with. Usernames (even if retired) should be unique.
* <a href="#18:03.28" id="18:03.28">18:03.28 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Since a retired user isn't wiped from tickets, assignments (links, nosy lists etc.) it would be confusing if there were two different people with the same name.
