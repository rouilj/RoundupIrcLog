* <a href="#10:57.47" id="10:57.47">10:57.47 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: I have a few questions regarding security and authentication of new users
* <a href="#10:58.35" id="10:58.35">10:58.35 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: Can someone tell me, is there a way to "acknowledge" a new user that registered *before* the user gets an email link to complete their registration?
* <a href="#10:59.11" id="10:59.11">10:59.11 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: also once the user signs out, it looks like that web browser can still view items that were previously submitted
* <a href="#11:00.09" id="11:00.09">11:00.09 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: If it's in the browser cache, sure.  Otherwise I've never been able to view stuff after log out.
* <a href="#11:00.13" id="11:00.13">11:00.13 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: in fact even when no one is signed in, the browser operator can "Show All" items. Do I have that correct?
* <a href="#11:00.30" id="11:00.30">11:00.30 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: It depends on what permissions the anonymous user has.
* <a href="#11:00.59" id="11:00.59">11:00.59 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: hmm, is there a way to prevent an anonymous user from doing anything on the browser?
* <a href="#11:01.18" id="11:01.18">11:01.18 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: i guess i am not sure that matters, if they can just register and get an email immediately to allow them in
* <a href="#11:01.23" id="11:01.23">11:01.23 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: is that a feature?
* <a href="#11:01.45" id="11:01.45">11:01.45 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: For some definition of "anything" yes.  Take away it's permission to view all objects, and it will just get empty pages.
* <a href="#11:01.52" id="11:01.52">11:01.52 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: s/it's/its/
* <a href="#11:02.10" id="11:02.10">11:02.10 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: I would expect a "middle man" such as an administrator to get an email, then "allowing" or "disallowing' that new user from gaining access before that user receives the confirmation email
* <a href="#11:02.36" id="11:02.36">11:02.36 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: how do I take the permission away?
* <a href="#11:02.44" id="11:02.44">11:02.44 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Edit the user's roles.
* <a href="#11:03.40" id="11:03.40">11:03.40 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I don't know if there is any built in support for administrator approval, but it shouldn't be hard to add if not.  Someone may have written an add-on already.
* <a href="#11:05.30" id="11:05.30">11:05.30 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: By default (IIRC) the anonymous user (that's litterally its name) has the role 'anonymous', so if you adjust what permissions that role has, you adjust what a non-authed user can see.
* <a href="#11:06.18" id="11:06.18">11:06.18 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: If you just want anonymous to not be able to see anything, you can just remove the role 'anonymous' from the anonymous account in the user edit screen (as an admin).
* <a href="#11:07.02" id="11:07.02">11:07.02 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Again, if I recall correctly, it's been a while since I played with a new install :)
* <a href="#11:08.38" id="11:08.38">11:08.38 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: ok so I am looking at a file "schema.py" which seems to have some calls to add anonymous support
* <a href="#11:09.02" id="11:09.02">11:09.02 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: if I just comment those out, then that feature would not be enabled?
* <a href="#11:33.55" id="11:33.55">11:33.55 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I believe so.  If you remove Web Access, they probably can't even get to the registration page, though I don't think I've ever experimented with that.
* <a href="#11:34.49" id="11:34.49">11:34.49 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: In my own tracker with no public info I only give anonymous Web Access and Register
* <a href="#11:36.20" id="11:36.20">11:36.20 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Oh, removing Web Access might not work, because there'd be no way to access the login page.
* <a href="#12:02.34" id="12:02.34">12:02.34 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: So I edited the schema.py and commented out the anonymous settings. Now the web page prints a banner saying no anonymous user may log in, and, there is no option to create a new user.
* <a href="#12:02.42" id="12:02.42">12:02.42 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: that is just what I was looking for
* <a href="#12:02.51" id="12:02.51">12:02.51 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: thanks for the help
* <a href="#12:03.22" id="12:03.22">12:03.22 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc95284](https://github.com/qwebirc95284)__: i just want to log in via the 'admin' user, and it looks like i can do that fine now
