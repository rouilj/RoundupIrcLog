# Roundup IRC Log for 2024-03-10
* <a href="#10:59.27" id="10:59.27">10:59.27 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: Hello Everyone!

* <a href="#11:02.00" id="11:02.00">11:02.00 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: I do not understand a codeline in the issue.item.html of the classic template

* <a href="#11:02.53" id="11:02.53">11:02.53 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: ha, i might found it

* <a href="#11:04.11" id="11:04.11">11:04.11 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: almost. :(

* <a href="#11:04.30" id="11:04.30">11:04.30 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: so here is a link to the codeline <https://codeberg.org/R2D2/roundup_todo_tracker_template/src/commit/e9eb1610830f8c188de1bfa0c6fbd8d560739d84/todo/html/issue.item.html#L79>
* <a href="#11:04.55" id="11:04.55">11:04.55 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: i want to extend this with a second keyword field named project

* <a href="#11:05.57" id="11:05.57">11:05.57 (EDT)</a> - __[r2d2](https://github.com/r2d2)__: is there a way to use something like an format-string within the filter='...' expression?

* <a href="#14:12.38" id="14:12.38">14:12.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: r2d2 filter='status=waiting,in progress,needs attention;keyword=%s' % context.keyword.plain()

* <a href="#14:14.27" id="14:14.27">14:14.27 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it's python at that point. I assume you are trying to find all waiting inprogress ... issues that match the current context.

* <a href="#14:33.53" id="14:33.53">14:33.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Searching with mutlilinks is a bit tricky. What you have I think will be an or search by default. So if there were two keywords you would get any project that has either keyword.
