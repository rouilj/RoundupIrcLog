* <a href="#09:48.15" id="09:48.15">09:48.15 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I have two questions about roundup:
* <a href="#09:48.54" id="09:48.54">09:48.54 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: a) can I handle several projects in the same installation, and can I have overviews of all projects? and most importantly
* <a href="#09:49.03" id="09:49.03">09:49.03 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: b) is there any android client app?
* <a href="#09:53.01" id="09:53.01">09:53.01 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I have another one
* <a href="#09:53.48" id="09:53.48">09:53.48 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: c) base64.decodestring() is going to be removes in py3.9, should I open an issue about it? I can't find any and for some reason I already have 3.9 in this machine
* <a href="#10:02.23" id="10:02.23">10:02.23 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: see <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html?highlight=decodestring#id111> <https://bugs.python.org/issue39351>
* <a href="#10:10.33" id="10:10.33">10:10.33 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ok, I found the answer for a), which is no but yes (just add a property)
* <a href="#10:32.25" id="10:32.25">10:32.25 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: d) do I have to encrypt the password when adding a user in the command line? like ./bin/roundup-admin create user username=mdione password=???
* <a href="#10:39.24" id="10:39.24">10:39.24 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: StyXman: Hi there.  I'm sure that someone more knowledgeable than I will be around eventually.  It gets quiet here on the weekends.
* <a href="#10:39.36" id="10:39.36">10:39.36 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: heeh
* <a href="#10:39.42" id="10:39.42">10:39.42 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I got d) too :)
* <a href="#10:40.00" id="10:40.00">10:40.00 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: so right now mots important would be b)
* <a href="#10:40.33" id="10:40.33">10:40.33 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: I can tell you that waaaay back whe I was running a Roundup install myself, I used it effectively to manage multiple projects.  This would have been annoying if they weren't all projects within the same organization, however.
* <a href="#10:40.45" id="10:40.45">10:40.45 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: and yeah, IRC is async, that's why I didn't ragequit 15s after nobody answered :-P
* <a href="#10:41.05" id="10:41.05">10:41.05 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: StyXman: so many people do...
* <a href="#10:41.36" id="10:41.36">10:41.36 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: _I know_! :)
* <a href="#10:44.30" id="10:44.30">10:44.30 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: yay, I got Project working :)
* <a href="#10:45.14" id="10:45.14">10:45.14 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: for the logs, d) you just set the password and it gets encrypted automatically
* <a href="#10:47.16" id="10:47.16">10:47.16 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: any nice css? the default view looks a little harsh :)
* <a href="#11:12.15" id="11:12.15">11:12.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman there is no android client. You do have full control over the HTML and can make it responsive however. See: <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo>/  for example.
* <a href="#11:13.01" id="11:13.01">11:13.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The roundup project has been looking for somebody interested in modifying the classic skin to make it nicer and more responsive.
* <a href="#11:13.12" id="11:13.12">11:13.12 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: rouilj: then it comes down to the cSS thing :)
* <a href="#11:13.23" id="11:13.23">11:13.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You may want to try the jinja2 template. IIRC that uses boostrap to be responsive.
* <a href="#11:13.50" id="11:13.50">11:13.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct the changes should be doable via css.
* <a href="#11:14.16" id="11:14.16">11:14.16 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ahmmmmm, can I switch templates easily?
* <a href="#11:14.24" id="11:14.24">11:14.24 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Note the jinja2 template is still new and may be missing sone functonality. We have a few users who contribute back patchs for it.
* <a href="#11:15.47" id="11:15.47">11:15.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: At setup it's easy. demo.py and answer jinja2 when is asks for the tracker.
* <a href="#11:16.42" id="11:16.42">11:16.42 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: SyXman are you using the 2.0.0 source tarball or did yu get a package from somewhere?
* <a href="#11:17.04" id="11:17.04">11:17.04 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman that is.
* <a href="#11:18.11" id="11:18.11">11:18.11 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: pypi
* <a href="#11:18.46" id="11:18.46">11:18.46 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: 2.0.0
* <a href="#11:20.22" id="11:20.22">11:20.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok, then to upgrade an existing tracker you should be able to copy the jinja2 template files I think in /usr/share/python3/roundup/trackers/jinja2 (but not sure I always install from source).
* <a href="#11:23.09" id="11:23.09">11:23.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: pip3 install jinja2. Then copy the html and static directories to your tracker's home directory. Then set the following in config.ini in the [main] section:
* <a href="#11:23.18" id="11:23.18">11:23.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: template_engine = jinja2
* <a href="#11:23.25" id="11:23.25">11:23.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: static_files = static
* <a href="#11:24.21" id="11:24.21">11:24.21 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: so, just the last two things?
* <a href="#11:24.31" id="11:24.31">11:24.31 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: this is mostly freshly installes, except for a)
* <a href="#11:24.51" id="11:24.51">11:24.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Right just change the last two. Leave the rest of your config.ini the same. Also there is a responsive template based on the TAL templating language (just like classic).
* <a href="#11:26.27" id="11:26.27">11:26.27 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you may want to run roundup-demo and try out the responsive and jinja2 templates (last requires installing jinja2). See which you like better.
* <a href="#11:27.13" id="11:27.13">11:27.13 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: Speaking of looking for someone to make a more modern, responsive skin... do you have the time and energy to mentor a student through that process?  Once or twice per year, CISE (the latest stupid name for our CS department) offers me some student labor at no/minimal charge.  That sounds like a task the right student could handle.
* <a href="#11:27.23" id="11:27.23">11:27.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: chnging the static directory and files under html should be all you need to change the trackers.
* <a href="#11:27.38" id="11:27.38">11:27.38 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Next opportunity will probably be a couple months after the start of the fall semester, when the new batch have settled in.
* <a href="#11:27.38" id="11:27.38">11:27.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Alternatively, just build a nw tracker and move yur schema.ini changes over.
* <a href="#11:29.11" id="11:29.11">11:29.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hello HedgeMage perhaps. Would the student already have knowledge about how to do the design and just eed help with the roundupy bits?
* <a href="#11:29.26" id="11:29.26">11:29.26 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: # Possible values are 'zopetal' for the old TAL engine
* <a href="#11:29.26" id="11:29.26">11:29.26 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: # ported from Zope, or 'chameleon' for Chameleon.
* <a href="#11:29.30" id="11:29.30">11:29.30 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: that one?
* <a href="#11:29.54" id="11:29.54">11:29.54 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: afk
* <a href="#11:30.03" id="11:30.03">11:30.03 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: Pretty much, though about 2/3 of the students we get are also fairly poor at task management, so you'd probably have to break the project down into chunks for them, and do regular-ish check-ins.
* <a href="#11:31.26" id="11:31.26">11:31.26 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: The professors never assign them anything with a timespan over a couple of weeks or a complication beyond "toy project", so writing real code tends to be a new experience.  On the up side, it's hard to break things too badly by styling something. ;)
* <a href="#11:38.46" id="11:38.46">11:38.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman yeah that one. It will accept jina2 as well. jinja2 is still experimental (see installation.txt). Also the jinja2 template supports simpleMde for editing in markdown format.
* <a href="#11:39.31" id="11:39.31">11:39.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so it is more complex. Note that markdown support is still a bit cuting edge.
* <a href="#11:39.43" id="11:39.43">11:39.43 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ack
* <a href="#11:39.52" id="11:39.52">11:39.52 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: seems to lack any css at all
* <a href="#11:40.00" id="11:40.00">11:40.00 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: either thta or my setup is not complete
* <a href="#11:40.17" id="11:40.17">11:40.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: did you bring over the static directory?
* <a href="#11:40.31" id="11:40.31">11:40.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and set the static config option?
* <a href="#11:41.01" id="11:41.01">11:41.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I haven't tried it in a while (probably just before the 2.0.0 release)
* <a href="#11:41.40" id="11:41.40">11:41.40 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: bring over? It's all the only and single setup
* <a href="#11:41.44" id="11:41.44">11:41.44 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: because some changes in 2.0.0 required changs to all the tracker templates.
* <a href="#11:42.19" id="11:42.19">11:42.19 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman are you changing your existing tracker to use jinja2 or are you running a demo jinja2 tracker?
* <a href="#11:43.02" id="11:43.02">11:43.02 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: existring, mostly fresh tracker
* <a href="#11:43.08" id="11:43.08">11:43.08 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: this is just an internal demo for me
* <a href="#11:43.40" id="11:43.40">11:43.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah so you need to copy the static directory from the jinja2 template directory and copy the html directory into your html directory.
* <a href="#11:44.01" id="11:44.01">11:44.01 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: from... the sources?
* <a href="#11:44.10" id="11:44.10">11:44.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you are just doing a demo, try running roundup-demo to initalize a new jinja2 tracker for testing.
* <a href="#11:44.10" id="11:44.10">11:44.10 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: becasue pip install didn't install any of that
* <a href="#11:44.34" id="11:44.34">11:44.34 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: pip should have installed all of the template directoeis otherwise roundup-admin won;t work to initialize a new tracker.
* <a href="#11:44.48" id="11:44.48">11:44.48 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I guess the setup.py file is incomplete?
* <a href="#11:45.10" id="11:45.10">11:45.10 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ah, I see, in share
* <a href="#11:45.14" id="11:45.14">11:45.14 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if you are runing from pip you shouldn't hve a setup.py I don't think.
* <a href="#11:45.35" id="11:45.35">11:45.35 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: let me try a pip install (been very long) and see what it does.
* <a href="#11:46.04" id="11:46.04">11:46.04 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: no, I don't have one, but pip runs setup.py internally
* <a href="#11:46.16" id="11:46.16">11:46.16 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: no, I found them, thy're in share
* <a href="#11:46.38" id="11:46.38">11:46.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah that should have installed all of the source bundles share/roundup/templates/clasic, jinja2, responsive ...
* <a href="#11:46.47" id="11:46.47">11:46.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah good you found them.
* <a href="#11:47.55" id="11:47.55">11:47.55 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: what's need-eg and done-cbb?
* <a href="#11:47.58" id="11:47.58">11:47.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you chould see a config_ini.ini file in some tracker template directories. For example for jinja2, it changes the templte engine and static directories. For responsive it changs the static directory.
* <a href="#11:48.07" id="11:48.07">11:48.07 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: yeah, I saw it, tx
* <a href="#11:48.08" id="11:48.08">11:48.08 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: need example; done could be better;
* <a href="#11:48.56" id="11:48.56">11:48.56 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ok, yeahm jinja looks better
* <a href="#11:49.01" id="11:49.01">11:49.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you can redefine those in your running tracker using the class editor as a user with with the admin role (or use the admin user).
* <a href="#11:50.06" id="11:50.06">11:50.06 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you may want to join the roundup-user's mailing list. The people who use/develop the jinja2 template are on that list. I don't know much about that template.
* <a href="#11:51.02" id="11:51.02">11:51.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also StyXman I assume thi is an internal demo for work. What attracted you to roundup?
* <a href="#11:51.04" id="11:51.04">11:51.04 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: oh, md, looks so good
* <a href="#11:51.45" id="11:51.45">11:51.45 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ... except not in the message view
* <a href="#11:51.55" id="11:51.55">11:51.55 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you also need to install a markdown package in python to see it formatted in the web interface.
* <a href="#11:52.20" id="11:52.20">11:52.20 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ah, ok
* <a href="#11:53.15" id="11:53.15">11:53.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: we support: markdown2, markdown, mistune.
* <a href="#11:54.04" id="11:54.04">11:54.04 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: *StyXman happy*
* <a href="#11:54.25" id="11:54.25">11:54.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: with varying degrees of success. None of them exactly reproduce what simpleMDE generates. (side effect of markdown not bing a well specified language). We try to configure them to be as close to git flavored mrkdown as we can.
* <a href="#11:54.59" id="11:54.59">11:54.59 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if you check out issues.roundup-tracker.org (a roundup instance so we do eat our own dog food)
* <a href="#11:55.13" id="11:55.13">11:55.13 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you will see a couple of open markdown tickets.
* <a href="#11:56.01" id="11:56.01">11:56.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman What attracted you to roundup?
* <a href="#11:56.09" id="11:56.09">11:56.09 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: good question
* <a href="#11:57.22" id="11:57.22">11:57.22 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I have several projects, mostly own dog food. I have very few moments that I can dedicate to them (2 small kids), and sometimes I find myself with time and no task
* <a href="#11:57.51" id="11:57.51">11:57.51 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: so I just wanted something where to pour the todo lists and see them all in one go
* <a href="#11:59.28" id="11:59.28">11:59.28 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: another option is cil and make one project merging them all
* <a href="#11:59.44" id="11:59.44">11:59.44 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: but I also want to share our house's todo with the partner
* <a href="#12:00.58" id="12:00.58">12:00.58 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: You do not have permission to login <-- I just created this user, what's missing?
* <a href="#12:03.12" id="12:03.12">12:03.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: can you log in as admin?
* <a href="#12:04.18" id="12:04.18">12:04.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also wha roles did you give to the user?
* <a href="#12:12.03" id="12:12.03">12:12.03 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: none
* <a href="#12:12.07" id="12:12.07">12:12.07 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: got it
* <a href="#12:12.15" id="12:12.15">12:12.15 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: nmnnnnnnnn nnnnnnnnnnnnnm nm mmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm           m    m

* <a href="#12:12.29" id="12:12.29">12:12.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also StyXMan the decodestring issue is fixed in the development code.
* <a href="#12:14.07" id="12:14.07">12:14.07 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yup you need a role defined for the user that has Web Access rights. Usually the 'User' role will work. They also usually get Rest, XmlRpc and Email access.
* <a href="#12:16.02" id="12:16.02">12:16.02 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hmm, I wonder if not specifying any role is a bug.... aybe there should be a default detector to stop user creation if no valid role is defined....
* <a href="#12:18.09" id="12:18.09">12:18.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the current detector only validates the roles if they exist.....
* <a href="#16:01.06" id="16:01.06">16:01.06 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: rouilj: well, it seems you can't disable a user, so either you change its password or you remove all roles :)
* <a href="#16:19.06" id="16:19.06">16:19.06 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you should be able to retire a user from the roundup-admin interface.
* <a href="#16:21.15" id="16:21.15">16:21.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I thought there was a retire user option available to the admin in the web interface. It looks like it's on the user index page.
* <a href="#16:21.35" id="16:21.35">16:21.35 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: and retire is not delete...
* <a href="#16:24.05" id="16:24.05">16:24.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you can't delete things from roundup. It destroys referential integrity of the database. E.G. Suppose user3 changed the status of issue1. Now delete user3. When you look at the history for issue1, there is stil a reference to user3.
* <a href="#16:25.20" id="16:25.20">16:25.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Somebody kind of messed up his roundup install by deleting a bunch of users. Ended up restoring the user table as there were too many references to the deleted users (history, nosy list, assignedto ....).
* <a href="#16:27.07" id="16:27.07">16:27.07 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: IIRC retired users shouldn't be able to login, but don't quote me on that.
