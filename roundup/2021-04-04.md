* <a href="#09:48.15" id="09:48.15">09:48.15 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I have two questions about roundup:
* <a href="#09:48.54" id="09:48.54">09:48.54 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: a) can I handle several projects in the same installation, and can I have overviews of all projects? and most importantly
* <a href="#09:49.03" id="09:49.03">09:49.03 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: b) is there any android client app?
* <a href="#09:53.01" id="09:53.01">09:53.01 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I have another one
* <a href="#09:53.48" id="09:53.48">09:53.48 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: c) base64.decodestring() is going to be removes in py3.9, should I open an issue about it? I can't find any and for some reason I already have 3.9 in this machine
* <a href="#10:02.23" id="10:02.23">10:02.23 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: see <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/changelog.html?highlight=decodestring#id111> <https://bugs.python.org/issue39351>
* <a href="#10:10.33" id="10:10.33">10:10.33 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ok, I found the answer for a), which is no but yes (just add a property)
* <a href="#10:32.25" id="10:32.25">10:32.25 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: d) do I have to encrypt the password when adding a user in the command line? like ./bin/roundup-admin create user username=mdione password=???
* <a href="#10:39.24" id="10:39.24">10:39.24 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: StyXman: Hi there.  I'm sure that someone more knowledgeable than I will be around eventually.  It gets quiet here on the weekends.
* <a href="#10:39.36" id="10:39.36">10:39.36 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: heeh
* <a href="#10:39.42" id="10:39.42">10:39.42 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: I got d) too :)
* <a href="#10:40.00" id="10:40.00">10:40.00 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: so right now mots important would be b)
* <a href="#10:40.33" id="10:40.33">10:40.33 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: I can tell you that waaaay back whe I was running a Roundup install myself, I used it effectively to manage multiple projects.  This would have been annoying if they weren't all projects within the same organization, however.
* <a href="#10:40.45" id="10:40.45">10:40.45 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: and yeah, IRC is async, that's why I didn't ragequit 15s after nobody answered :-P
* <a href="#10:41.05" id="10:41.05">10:41.05 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: StyXman: so many people do...
* <a href="#10:41.36" id="10:41.36">10:41.36 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: _I know_! :)
* <a href="#10:44.30" id="10:44.30">10:44.30 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: yay, I got Project working :)
* <a href="#10:45.14" id="10:45.14">10:45.14 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: for the logs, d) you just set the password and it gets encrypted automatically
* <a href="#10:47.16" id="10:47.16">10:47.16 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: any nice css? the default view looks a little harsh :)
* <a href="#11:12.15" id="11:12.15">11:12.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman there is no android client. You do have full control over the HTML and can make it responsive however. See: <https://rouilj.dynamic-dns.net/demo>/  for example.
* <a href="#11:13.01" id="11:13.01">11:13.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The roundup project has been looking for somebody interested in modifying the classic skin to make it nicer and more responsive.
* <a href="#11:13.12" id="11:13.12">11:13.12 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: rouilj: then it comes down to the cSS thing :)
* <a href="#11:13.23" id="11:13.23">11:13.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You may want to try the jinja2 template. IIRC that uses boostrap to be responsive.
* <a href="#11:13.50" id="11:13.50">11:13.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct the changes should be doable via css.
* <a href="#11:14.16" id="11:14.16">11:14.16 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: ahmmmmm, can I switch templates easily?
* <a href="#11:14.24" id="11:14.24">11:14.24 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Note the jinja2 template is still new and may be missing sone functonality. We have a few users who contribute back patchs for it.
* <a href="#11:15.47" id="11:15.47">11:15.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: At setup it's easy. demo.py and answer jinja2 when is asks for the tracker.
* <a href="#11:16.42" id="11:16.42">11:16.42 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: SyXman are you using the 2.0.0 source tarball or did yu get a package from somewhere?
* <a href="#11:17.04" id="11:17.04">11:17.04 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: StyXman that is.
* <a href="#11:18.11" id="11:18.11">11:18.11 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: pypi
* <a href="#11:18.46" id="11:18.46">11:18.46 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: 2.0.0
* <a href="#11:20.22" id="11:20.22">11:20.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ok, then to upgrade an existing tracker you should be able to copy the jinja2 template files I think in /usr/share/python3/roundup/trackers/jinja2 (but not sure I always install from source).
* <a href="#11:23.09" id="11:23.09">11:23.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: pip3 install jinja2. Then copy the html and static directories to your tracker's home directory. Then set the following in config.ini in the [main] section:
* <a href="#11:23.18" id="11:23.18">11:23.18 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: template_engine = jinja2
* <a href="#11:23.25" id="11:23.25">11:23.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: static_files = static
* <a href="#11:24.21" id="11:24.21">11:24.21 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: so, just the last two things?
* <a href="#11:24.31" id="11:24.31">11:24.31 (EDT)</a> - __[StyXman](https://github.com/StyXman)__: this is mostly freshly installes, except for a)
* <a href="#11:24.51" id="11:24.51">11:24.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Right just change the last two. Leave the rest of your config.ini the same. Also there is a responsive template based on the TAL templating language (just like classic).
* <a href="#11:26.27" id="11:26.27">11:26.27 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you may want to run roundup-demo and try out the responsive and jinja2 templates (last requires installing jinja2). See which you like better.
* <a href="#11:27.13" id="11:27.13">11:27.13 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: Speaking of looking for someone to make a more modern, responsive skin... do you have the time and energy to mentor a student through that process?  Once or twice per year, CISE (the latest stupid name for our CS department) offers me some student labor at no/minimal charge.  That sounds like a task the right student could handle.
* <a href="#11:27.23" id="11:27.23">11:27.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: chnging the static directory and files under html should be all you need to change the trackers.
* <a href="#11:27.38" id="11:27.38">11:27.38 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Next opportunity will probably be a couple months after the start of the fall semester, when the new batch have settled in.
* <a href="#11:27.38" id="11:27.38">11:27.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Alternatively, just build a nw tracker and move yur schema.ini changes over.
