* <a href="#02:02.57" id="02:02.57">02:02.57 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Hm
* <a href="#02:03.27" id="02:03.27">02:03.27 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: first history in our tracker svn repo is from 16 nov 2006
* <a href="#02:03.52" id="02:03.52">02:03.52 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: but it might be older stuff there
* <a href="#03:13.43" id="03:13.43">03:13.43 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: I can report that the patch you provided me on the list works, I used the re.sub method
* <a href="#05:21.14" id="05:21.14">05:21.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: <rouilj> Taggnostr see above. Have you seen this? If so did you tell me and I forgot about it? <- haven't seen any of this, but I think I usually wrap those in an int() to avoid ending up with strings, so any inconsistency would have been eliminated by the int() call (including the L issue)
* <a href="#06:12.03" id="06:12.03">06:12.03 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: hm can you cast 1234L to an int?
* <a href="#06:12.25" id="06:12.25">06:12.25 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: print(int('23L')) wouldn't work ?
* <a href="#06:42.11" id="06:42.11">06:42.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon
* <a href="#06:42.12" id="06:42.12">06:42.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: >>> print(int('23L'))
* <a href="#06:42.12" id="06:42.12">06:42.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Traceback (most recent call last):
* <a href="#06:42.12" id="06:42.12">06:42.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
* <a href="#06:42.12" id="06:42.12">06:42.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '23L'
* <a href="#06:42.45" id="06:42.45">06:42.45 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so no. Also to do it, you would have to parse out the 23L from the tuple string which is going to be diffeicult.
* <a href="#07:55.17" id="07:55.17">07:55.17 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: yeah.. I was just wondering how Taggnostr was doing it =)
* <a href="#07:55.53" id="07:55.53">07:55.53 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: or maybe I misunderstood him when he wrote "the int() call (including the L issue)"
* <a href="#08:11.19" id="08:11.19">08:11.19 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> 2**62
* <a href="#08:11.19" id="08:11.19">08:11.19 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 4611686018427387904
* <a href="#08:11.19" id="08:11.19">08:11.19 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> 2**63
* <a href="#08:11.19" id="08:11.19">08:11.19 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 9223372036854775808L
* <a href="#08:11.20" id="08:11.20">08:11.20 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> int(_)
* <a href="#08:11.23" id="08:11.23">08:11.23 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 9223372036854775808L
* <a href="#08:12.15" id="08:12.15">08:12.15 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: the max value for int is quite big, and if you try to convert a long that is over the max value to int you still get a long
* <a href="#08:12.53" id="08:12.53">08:12.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> sys.maxint
* <a href="#08:12.53" id="08:12.53">08:12.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 9223372036854775807
* <a href="#08:12.53" id="08:12.53">08:12.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> 2**63-1
* <a href="#08:12.53" id="08:12.53">08:12.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: 9223372036854775807L
* <a href="#08:15.15" id="08:15.15">08:15.15 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: if you have the L in the string then you could .rstrip() it, in my case I either had ints, strings without L, and perhaps longs that were small enough to convert them to int (as numbers, not as strings)
* <a href="#08:15.40" id="08:15.40">08:15.40 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: also note that 1L + 2 will give you 3L
* <a href="#08:20.29" id="08:20.29">08:20.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr, I think that's maxint on python3, not python2. but 2^31 is still a pretty big number.
* <a href="#08:23.33" id="08:23.33">08:23.33 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: it depends how python is compiled (or if the system is 32 or 64 bit), even though I think on python3 the distinction was removed (together with long)
* <a href="#08:36.39" id="08:36.39">08:36.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct. That's the issue. 1234L is not parsed by python3, but shows up in the params in some journals. Looks like it was a bug with id representation as an int rather than as a string. Fixed at/before the 1.2.0 release in 2006. So my guess is you might not see it since IIRC your tracker started in late 2006.
* <a href="#08:38.33" id="08:38.33">08:38.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but I see it on the roundup tracker which should have the same history. I wonder if the roundup tracker was a dump/restore of an earlier version so carried over the id is int versus id is string representation.
* <a href="#09:48.03" id="09:48.03">09:48.03 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I'm so happy that my problems raises confusions and getting people digging into archives
* <a href="#09:48.06" id="09:48.06">09:48.06 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: ;)
* <a href="#09:49.07" id="09:49.07">09:49.07 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I've spent more or less the whole day writing up selinux policy rules for the communication chain postgresql+roundup+roundup-mailgw+procmail
* <a href="#09:49.50" id="09:49.50">09:49.50 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: think I've finally nailed down the last piece for context label in place
