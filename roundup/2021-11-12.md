* <a href="#03:13.43" id="03:13.43">03:13.43 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: I can report that the patch you provided me on the list works, I used the re.sub method
* <a href="#05:21.14" id="05:21.14">05:21.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: <rouilj> Taggnostr see above. Have you seen this? If so did you tell me and I forgot about it? <- haven't seen any of this, but I think I usually wrap those in an int() to avoid ending up with strings, so any inconsistency would have been eliminated by the int() call (including the L issue)
