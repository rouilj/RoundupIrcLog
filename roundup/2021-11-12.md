* <a href="#02:02.57" id="02:02.57">02:02.57 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Hm
* <a href="#02:03.27" id="02:03.27">02:03.27 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: first history in our tracker svn repo is from 16 nov 2006
* <a href="#02:03.52" id="02:03.52">02:03.52 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: but it might be older stuff there
* <a href="#03:13.43" id="03:13.43">03:13.43 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: I can report that the patch you provided me on the list works, I used the re.sub method
* <a href="#05:21.14" id="05:21.14">05:21.14 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: <rouilj> Taggnostr see above. Have you seen this? If so did you tell me and I forgot about it? <- haven't seen any of this, but I think I usually wrap those in an int() to avoid ending up with strings, so any inconsistency would have been eliminated by the int() call (including the L issue)
* <a href="#06:12.03" id="06:12.03">06:12.03 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: hm can you cast 1234L to an int?
* <a href="#06:12.25" id="06:12.25">06:12.25 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: print(int('23L')) wouldn't work ?
