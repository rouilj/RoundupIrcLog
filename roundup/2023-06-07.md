* <a href="#07:40.22" id="07:40.22">07:40.22 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: Hi there, I know nothing about roundup and I have been tasked to update it, I am going from 1.3.3 to 2.2.0 but firstly I am going from 1.3.3 to 1.4.0, but im not sure what i need to change, and also where to add the database, if anyone can let me know or tell me where I can ask that would be great thans

* <a href="#09:01.24" id="09:01.24">09:01.24 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: If you are upgrading you shouldn't need to "add" the database, so I'm not sure what your question means.  As for the upgrade steps, they should be in the documentation.  Did you have specific places where the upgrade documentation leaves you with questions?  (Note: it has been a long time since I've done an upgrade, and I'm not on 2.x (yet?) so I may not actually be much help in
