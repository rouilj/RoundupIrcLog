# Roundup IRC Log for 2023-06-07
* <a href="#07:40.22" id="07:40.22">07:40.22 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: Hi there, I know nothing about roundup and I have been tasked to update it, I am going from 1.3.3 to 2.2.0 but firstly I am going from 1.3.3 to 1.4.0, but im not sure what i need to change, and also where to add the database, if anyone can let me know or tell me where I can ask that would be great thans

* <a href="#09:01.24" id="09:01.24">09:01.24 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: If you are upgrading you shouldn't need to "add" the database, so I'm not sure what your question means.  As for the upgrade steps, they should be in the documentation.  Did you have specific places where the upgrade documentation leaves you with questions?  (Note: it has been a long time since I've done an upgrade, and I'm not on 2.x (yet?) so I may not actually be much help in
* <a href="#09:01.27" id="09:01.27">09:01.27 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: answering the questions ;)

* <a href="#09:23.38" id="09:23.38">09:23.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The upgrading docs can be found at: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>
* <a href="#09:24.21" id="09:24.21">09:24.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if your original installation is not using python virtual environment, you should install the new version in a virtual environment (venv).

* <a href="#09:24.46" id="09:24.46">09:24.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc30753 last couple are for you.
* <a href="#09:25.02" id="09:25.02">09:25.02 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: Ah yes thank you

* <a href="#09:26.12" id="09:26.12">09:26.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc30753, note that version 2.3.0 of roundup is due to be released in the middle of next month.
* <a href="#09:26.19" id="09:26.19">09:26.19 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: sorry for my poor wording I meant in the documentation for 1.3.3 to 1.4.0 it says  "We recommend that you create the following database indexes on the database by hand:" what database am I adding these indexes to and where can I find it
* <a href="#09:26.27" id="09:26.27">09:26.27 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: ah i see

* <a href="#09:26.30" id="09:26.30">09:26.30 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah ok.
* <a href="#09:26.57" id="09:26.57">09:26.57 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume you have only one tracker?
* <a href="#09:27.05" id="09:27.05">09:27.05 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: yes

* <a href="#09:28.00" id="09:28.00">09:28.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: can you cat tracker_home/db/backend_name
* <a href="#09:28.23" id="09:28.23">09:28.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and tell me what it produces

* <a href="#09:29.56" id="09:29.56">09:29.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: (note that file is obsolete in newer Roundup. You will convert it when you hit the 1.5.1->1.6.0 upgrade steps IIRC.)
* <a href="#09:30.28" id="09:30.28">09:30.28 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: postgresql

* <a href="#09:30.43" id="09:30.43">09:30.43 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah good.

* <a href="#09:31.47" id="09:31.47">09:31.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So that is the database you will be updating. you can find out the database name, username for the db and password by looking in the config.ini file.
* <a href="#09:32.36" id="09:32.36">09:32.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Let me check to see if that option is covered by a roundup-admin migrate command.

* <a href="#09:33.14" id="09:33.14">09:33.14 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If not, you can use psql with the databasename/username/password to execute the sql commands (create index....)
* <a href="#09:33.21" id="09:33.21">09:33.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hang on for a sec.

* <a href="#09:34.21" id="09:34.21">09:34.21 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: i see, ok cool

* <a href="#09:36.25" id="09:36.25">09:36.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You will have to run those two commands using psql.
* <a href="#09:36.44" id="09:36.44">09:36.44 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it's not in the automatic migrations.

* <a href="#09:38.28" id="09:38.28">09:38.28 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: thanks for letting me know

* <a href="#09:46.35" id="09:46.35">09:46.35 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc30753 sure. Do you need a hand with the psql command or are you all set with that?

* <a href="#09:47.15" id="09:47.15">09:47.15 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc30753](https://github.com/qwebirc30753)__: i might need a hand with the psql command
* <a href="#09:47.43" id="09:47.43">09:47.43 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ok, let me test against my dev postgres server. I'l be back.

* <a href="#09:51.26" id="09:51.26">09:51.26 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: psql -d 'roundup_db'  -U roundup_user -c 'CREATE INDEX words_by_id ON __words (_textid);'

* <a href="#09:52.28" id="09:52.28">09:52.28 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: should work assuming your postgresql instance is on the same machine. It will prompt you for the password. The roundup_user and roundup_db (as well as the password) can be found in your config.ini.
* <a href="#09:53.22" id="09:53.22">09:53.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I assume you have a backup of the database (done using pgdump or with a proper point in time binary backup process). Am I correct?

* <a href="#09:54.19" id="09:54.19">09:54.19 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't remember hearing abut  bad upgrade and I have never had an upgrade go bad but I have only done 8 or so.

* <a href="#09:55.23" id="09:55.23">09:55.23 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: after you have run the 'CREATE INDEX words_by_id ON __words (_textid);', you can use the same command to run the 'CREATE INDEX words_by_id ON __words (_textid);' sql.

* <a href="#09:57.15" id="09:57.15">09:57.15 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I can't give a good estimate of the amount of time it will take to run these commands. It depends on the number of issues/messages/files in the tracker and how fast the computer and disks are. qwebirc30753
