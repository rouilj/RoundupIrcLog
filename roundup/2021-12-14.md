* <a href="#10:50.26" id="10:50.26">10:50.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m]  the work you did on setup.py to move from distutils to setuptools seems to have left a bunch of references to distutils in roundup/dist/commands/*. Since 3.12 is removing distutils entirely I am looking for ideas on what needs to happen there. We would IIUC need to support something that works on both python2 and python3 otherwise we wouldn't be able to install under python2 anymore. Suggestions?
* <a href="#13:01.37" id="13:01.37">13:01.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan and Taggnostr I think I have distutils removed form the most part. I need a replacement for: 'from distutils.command.build import build as base' however. Any pythonistas want to give it a shot?
* <a href="#14:30.01" id="14:30.01">14:30.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, I'm not familiar with distutils -- can't you use conditional imports to keep using distutils under py2?
* <a href="#14:35.57" id="14:35.57">14:35.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, I have no idea what to replace that distutils line with on python3 with only setuptools. Also we require setuptools on python2 to install so might as well remove all distutils references.
* <a href="#14:37.49" id="14:37.49">14:37.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: there is a build_py in setuptools but it' not obvious to me that:  from setuptools.command import build_py as base is a 1 for 1 replacement.
* <a href="#19:14.36" id="19:14.36">19:14.36 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: my recollection of that work is a bit vague. do you have links to the relevant commit(s)?
* <a href="#19:14.59" id="19:14.59">19:14.59 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I'll try an have a look when I get some spare time, which given I'm dealing with log4j stuff at the moment might be a while.
* <a href="#19:15.14" id="19:15.14">19:15.14 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: The alternative it maybe to just drop support for python2?
* <a href="#19:15.41" id="19:15.41">19:15.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: wilco. when you kan is fine. I'll poke you toward the end of the week if I don't hear back.
* <a href="#19:16.03" id="19:16.03">19:16.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well I need something to allow installing under python3 when distutils goes away.
* <a href="#19:16.43" id="19:16.43">19:16.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: right now a core part of the build infra is using distutils and I need the equivalent setuptools incantation for
* <a href="#19:17.00" id="19:17.00">19:17.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: from distutils.command.build import build as base
* <a href="#19:19.54" id="19:19.54">19:19.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/b57c3d50505b>
* <a href="#19:20.01" id="19:20.01">19:20.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thanks
* <a href="#19:20.40" id="19:20.40">19:20.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't suppose anybody here is a javascipt drag/drop expert?
* <a href="#19:21.18" id="19:21.18">19:21.18 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: ah yeah, I remember those changes. Couldn't remember if they got merged though (I thought there were some other issues blocking it)
* <a href="#19:47.36" id="19:47.36">19:47.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I handled the other issues (files being put in the wrong places) afterwards
