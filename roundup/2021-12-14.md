* <a href="#10:50.26" id="10:50.26">10:50.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m]  the work you did on setup.py to move from distutils to setuptools seems to have left a bunch of references to distutils in roundup/dist/commands/*. Since 3.12 is removing distutils entirely I am looking for ideas on what needs to happen there. We would IIUC need to support something that works on both python2 and python3 otherwise we wouldn't be able to install under python2 anymore. Suggestions?
