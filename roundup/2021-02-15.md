I managed to get the revese proxy working using http /port 80, but when I try using https/port 443, I get an error on the chrome browser saying "Mixed Content"
* <a href="#10:48.30" id="10:48.30">10:48.30 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: the details say the page contains a form that targets an insecure endpoint. So if i look at the source for the roundup login page, i see several references to "<http://<ip>/support>/"
* <a href="#10:49.40" id="10:49.40">10:49.40 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: which according to what I am reading is the cause. The roundup documentation says to get secure roundup, is to "proxy through Apache and use its SSL service."
* <a href="#10:50.36" id="10:50.36">10:50.36 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: I think I am trying to do that now and from the Apache side, it looks to be working. But the first https page displayed (the roundup login page), it shows up as "not secure" and the details are the error that I pasted above.

* <a href="#12:20.33" id="12:20.33">12:20.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: are you following the mod_wsgi instructions?
* <a href="#12:20.48" id="12:20.48">12:20.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume not since you say reverse proxy.
* <a href="#12:24.31" id="12:24.31">12:24.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you need to set the [tracker] web option on config.ini to use https. So the client connects to apache on 443, apache proxies over http (not https) to the roundup instance. Roundup uses the web value as the base URL for the instance and send the response upstream to apache which returns it to the client over the TLS connection. The client then sees the https url for links, base url etc.

* <a href="#12:34.08" id="12:34.08">12:34.08 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr IIRC the rest interface was done as a GSOC via the python organization. It turns out that google also has doc services via: <https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs> and the customization doc is in need of a rewrite into at least two docs. Would the python org be able to sponsor this work?

I want to have the roundup-server be a systemctl service, but without selinux enforcement. However the rest of the system will have selinux=enforcing.

* <a href="#17:06.24" id="17:06.24">17:06.24 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: that's an selinux question, not a roundup question, as far as I know.
* <a href="#17:06.50" id="17:06.50">17:06.50 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: but i think there must be some code buried in roundup to allow it to be enforced
* <a href="#17:07.58" id="17:07.58">17:07.58 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: No, selinux does the enforcing.
