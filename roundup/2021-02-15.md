# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-02-15
* <a href="#10:47.21" id="10:47.21">10:47.21 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: Hi! I am trying to get roundup behind a reverse proxy'ed apache. I managed to get the revese proxy working using http /port 80, but when I try using https/port 443, I get an error on the chrome browser saying "Mixed Content"
* <a href="#10:48.30" id="10:48.30">10:48.30 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: the details say the page contains a form that targets an insecure endpoint. So if i look at the source for the roundup login page, i see several references to "<http://<ip>/support>/"
* <a href="#10:49.40" id="10:49.40">10:49.40 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: which according to what I am reading is the cause. The roundup documentation says to get secure roundup, is to "proxy through Apache and use its SSL service."
* <a href="#10:50.36" id="10:50.36">10:50.36 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: I think I am trying to do that now and from the Apache side, it looks to be working. But the first https page displayed (the roundup login page), it shows up as "not secure" and the details are the error that I pasted above.
* <a href="#10:50.59" id="10:50.59">10:50.59 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: Does anyone have experience using https and Apache?
* <a href="#12:19.33" id="12:19.33">12:19.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc83699 you really need to stay in the room if you expect anybody to help.
* <a href="#12:20.33" id="12:20.33">12:20.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: are you following the mod_wsgi instructions?
* <a href="#12:20.48" id="12:20.48">12:20.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume not since you say reverse proxy.
* <a href="#12:24.31" id="12:24.31">12:24.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you need to set the [tracker] web option on config.ini to use https. So the client connects to apache on 443, apache proxies over http (not https) to the roundup instance. Roundup uses the web value as the base URL for the instance and send the response upstream to apache which returns it to the client over the TLS connection. The client then sees the https url for links, base url etc.
* <a href="#12:25.12" id="12:25.12">12:25.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if you are not going to stay in irc, you realy should join the roundup-user mailing list and post there. Works beter for async help.
* <a href="#12:34.08" id="12:34.08">12:34.08 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr IIRC the rest interface was done as a GSOC via the python organization. It turns out that google also has doc services via: <https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs> and the customization doc is in need of a rewrite into at least two docs. Would the python org be able to sponsor this work?
* <a href="#17:04.48" id="17:04.48">17:04.48 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: Hi!  Is there a way to remove roundup from the selinux configuration? I want to have the roundup-server be a systemctl service, but without selinux enforcement. However the rest of the system will have selinux=enforcing.
* <a href="#17:05.34" id="17:05.34">17:05.34 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: Right now, the roundup service file and selinux will not allow the roundup-server to start with selinux=enforcing
* <a href="#17:06.09" id="17:06.09">17:06.09 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: the audit2allow tool used to allow the operation to start does not work (produces Failed to resolve typeattributset statement error)
* <a href="#17:06.24" id="17:06.24">17:06.24 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: that's an selinux question, not a roundup question, as far as I know.
* <a href="#17:06.50" id="17:06.50">17:06.50 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: but i think there must be some code buried in roundup to allow it to be enforced
* <a href="#17:07.58" id="17:07.58">17:07.58 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: No, selinux does the enforcing.
* <a href="#17:08.04" id="17:08.04">17:08.04 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: As I understand it :)
* <a href="#17:09.16" id="17:09.16">17:09.16 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: hmm, i just created a "test" service called "/usr/bin/roundup-server2"
* <a href="#17:09.29" id="17:09.29">17:09.29 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: it is a shell script that echoes the date to /tmp/out every second
* <a href="#17:09.41" id="17:09.41">17:09.41 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: systemctl daemon-reload
* <a href="#17:09.43" id="17:09.43">17:09.43 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: systemctl start test
* <a href="#17:09.45" id="17:09.45">17:09.45 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: tail -f /tmp/out
* <a href="#17:09.52" id="17:09.52">17:09.52 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: and the service is running just fine
* <a href="#17:10.18" id="17:10.18">17:10.18 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: both services (roundup and test) run as "roundup-admin"
* <a href="#17:10.28" id="17:10.28">17:10.28 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: why does "test" work fine, but "roundup" not start in enforcing mode?
* <a href="#17:11.21" id="17:11.21">17:11.21 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: i think something must be built into roundup-server to hook it into selinux so it is enforced
* <a href="#17:11.41" id="17:11.41">17:11.41 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: otherwise i think it should run fine, just like the "test" service
* <a href="#17:11.48" id="17:11.48">17:11.48 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc17078](https://github.com/qwebirc17078)__: what do you think?
* <a href="#22:37.34" id="22:37.34">22:37.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: bitdancer you are quite correct. There is no selinux interfacing code in roundup.
* <a href="#22:38.43" id="22:38.43">22:38.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc17078 needs to look at the log file and see what the error is. My guess is roundup can't bind to the network, but with no info on how his selinux is set up ....
* <a href="#22:40.26" id="22:40.26">22:40.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin and Taggnostr, <https://github.com/python/psf-infra-meta/issues> has a bunch of python issues reported. I can't close them, but it would be good to have somebody run though them, note they should be posted to bpo and not in the meta tracker, and close the issues.
* <a href="#22:41.26" id="22:41.26">22:41.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I have been trying to triage the issues there to see if there is low hanging fruit or something that should be cloned/referenced from the roundup issue tracker. Hence my noticing.
* <a href="#22:45.52" id="22:45.52">22:45.52 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: bitdancer is correct, but I think I understand how our guest got confused.  Many apps now distribute with recommended SELinux configurations relavent to their operation...sometimes, to just import into SELinux to cause it to ignore that application's activity (usually dumb, but common enough).  He may have expected something like that if he is unfamiliar with SELinux.
* <a href="#22:47.13" id="22:47.13">22:47.13 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: It's also worth noting that 9/10 times, that configuration is provided by RH or similar party that's a stakeholder in keeping SELinux enforcement active on various systems, not by the developer of the application in question.
* <a href="#22:53.25" id="22:53.25">22:53.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well for roundup I have: <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/RoundupWithApparmor> no selinux config though. Also AFAIK there is no RPM or deb for roundup. So I fail to see any way you could expect an SeLinux config to be installed.
* <a href="#22:53.48" id="22:53.48">22:53.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but I could se that as a source of confusion for inexperienced people.
* <a href="#22:54.26" id="22:54.26">22:54.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I agree I have seen RH supplied for some rpm's that is well less than stellar.
* <a href="#22:55.11" id="22:55.11">22:55.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: HedgeMage I don't suppose you have SeLinux chops enough to whip up a <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/RoundupWithSeLinux> ... 8-)
* <a href="#22:56.39" id="22:56.39">22:56.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurin and Taggnostr, I think you can create a template for github issues. It doesn't look like one exists currently. If I clone the repo and add a template can one of you merge the pull request?
* <a href="#22:57.59" id="22:57.59">22:57.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am thinking of something like:  NOTE this is NOT a tracker to report problems with python. You should report those to <https://bugs.python.org>. Issues here are for problems wih the bugs.python.org tracker and other python org infrastructure.
* <a href="#22:58.46" id="22:58.46">22:58.46 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: I'm not up to date enough to do it off the top of my head, no.  I'd need to sit down with an operating SELinux-based system and roundup for a while.
* <a href="#23:07.22" id="23:07.22">23:07.22 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Oh vell. It was an idea....
* <a href="#23:07.33" id="23:07.33">23:07.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: HedgeMage have a good night.
* <a href="#23:08.53" id="23:08.53">23:08.53 (EST)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: You, too.
