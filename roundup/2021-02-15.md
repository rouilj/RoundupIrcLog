I managed to get the revese proxy working using http /port 80, but when I try using https/port 443, I get an error on the chrome browser saying "Mixed Content"
* <a href="#10:48.30" id="10:48.30">10:48.30 (EST)</a> - __[qwebirc83699](https://github.com/qwebirc83699)__: the details say the page contains a form that targets an insecure endpoint. So if i look at the source for the roundup login page, i see several references to "<http://<ip>/support>/"

But the first https page displayed (the roundup login page), it shows up as "not secure" and the details are the error that I pasted above.
