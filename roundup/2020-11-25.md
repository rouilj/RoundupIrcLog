* <a id="10:08.43">10:08.43 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: As I see, I cannot actually delete msg3543 and file2342 files from the file system, just "retire" them. Is that true?
* <a id="10:09.20">10:09.20 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: But with email integration, it can happen that some spam messages or large attached files enters to my database.
* <a id="10:10.23">10:10.23 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: If I edit msg3543 or file2342 files, then my database remains consistent? (In this way, I could replace them with empty files, or add a possibility to the web interface to edit messages.)
* <a id="10:11.00">10:11.00 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: Does the database rely on some initial properties of these files? (length, md5sum, etc.)
* <a id="10:11.56">10:11.56 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: Thanks in advance.
