* <a id="10:07.27">10:07.27 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: Hello! I am new to roundup, but it seems very impressive, I really like its customisability.
* <a id="10:08.43">10:08.43 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: As I see, I cannot actually delete msg3543 and file2342 files from the file system, just "retire" them. Is that true?
* <a id="10:09.20">10:09.20 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: But with email integration, it can happen that some spam messages or large attached files enters to my database.
* <a id="10:10.23">10:10.23 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: If I edit msg3543 or file2342 files, then my database remains consistent? (In this way, I could replace them with empty files, or add a possibility to the web interface to edit messages.)
* <a id="10:11.00">10:11.00 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: Does the database rely on some initial properties of these files? (length, md5sum, etc.)
* <a id="10:11.56">10:11.56 (EST)</a> - __[ngaba](https://github.com/ngaba)__: Thanks in advance.
* <a id="10:46.48">10:46.48 (EST)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: I don't *remember* any dependencies on the file contents, but it's been a long time since I looked at that part of the code.  The CPython community has a spam detection plugin, by the way, with a mark as spam button.  I don't remember if it wipes out the files on disk or not, but it might be worth looking at that code.
