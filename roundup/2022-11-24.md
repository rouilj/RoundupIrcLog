# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-11-24
* <a href="#11:51.55" id="11:51.55">11:51.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Pythonistas: jerrykan, taggnostr, bitdancer, cmeerw I have a python problem and my google fu isn't good enough.
* <a href="#11:54.00" id="11:54.00">11:54.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am trying to create a class that inherits from one of 2 base classes at the time it runs init. However if I define the class with two parents, they conflict. I get an error that I can't resolve the order.
* <a href="#11:54.04" id="11:54.04">11:54.04 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: class TestTransport(xmlrpc_.client.Transport, xmlrpc_.client.SafeTransport):
* <a href="#11:54.05" id="11:54.05">11:54.05 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
* <a href="#11:54.06" id="11:54.06">11:54.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: order (MRO) for bases Transport, SafeTransport
* <a href="#11:55.10" id="11:55.10">11:55.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Is there some way for __init__ to say: hey my parent class should be  xmlrpc_.client.SafeTransport when it gets called?
* <a href="#11:55.46" id="11:55.46">11:55.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The reason I am doing this is I need to parse the URL passed in. If it is an https URL, I use SafeTransport, else I use Transport.
* <a href="#11:57.15" id="11:57.15">11:57.15 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Right now I look at the url in the caller and use either a SafeTransport based class or the Transport based class.
* <a href="#11:58.02" id="11:58.02">11:58.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: google keywords to look for would be helpful, links to how to do this even more so.

* <a href="#12:27.07" id="12:27.07">12:27.07 (EST)</a> - __[cmeerw[m]](https://github.com/cmeerw[m])__: the closest I have found is <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32598363/conditional-class-inheritance-in-python> which seems to be saying it's not possible

* <a href="#12:48.57" id="12:48.57">12:48.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, ok. I did come across some metaclass stuff, but it's causing brain damage as we type.
* <a href="#12:49.49" id="12:49.49">12:49.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also I would like this to work in python2 as well as three, but I can live without that if I need to. Just trying to get super() to play well with p2 and p3 is a pain.
* <a href="#12:50.03" id="12:50.03">12:50.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thanks cmeerw.
* <a href="#12:51.03" id="12:51.03">12:51.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: dynamic class inheritance looked like it might be the right terms, but I am not really making heads or tails of it.

* <a href="#14:54.47" id="14:54.47">14:54.47 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, not sure that's the best approach
* <a href="#14:55.10" id="14:55.10">14:55.10 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: maybe it would be better to figure out why the two base classes are conflicting
* <a href="#14:55.37" id="14:55.37">14:55.37 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I also have a feeling that SafeTransport already inherits from Transport, so you might not even need Transport
* <a href="#14:56.16" id="14:56.16">14:56.16 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: >>> Transport.__subclasses__()
* <a href="#14:56.17" id="14:56.17">14:56.17 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: [<class 'xmlrpc.client.SafeTransport'>]
* <a href="#14:56.46" id="14:56.46">14:56.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: But I can't turn of the ssl connection that safetrnsport uses if I have an http url.
* <a href="#14:57.49" id="14:57.49">14:57.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that seems to be the difference SafeTransport wraps Transport in ssl.

* <a href="#14:58.18" id="14:58.18">14:58.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: anyway I an going for a walk while I can.
* <a href="#14:58.20" id="14:58.20">14:58.20 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: one option could be to just proxy the methods
* <a href="#14:58.45" id="14:58.45">14:58.45 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: go on
* <a href="#14:58.47" id="14:58.47">14:58.47 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: so in the __init__ you can do self.transport = Transport(); self.safe_transport = SafeTransport()
* <a href="#14:59.38" id="14:59.38">14:59.38 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: and then in e.g. open you do if url.startswith('https'): self.safe_transport.open(url); else: self.transport.open(url)
* <a href="#14:59.53" id="14:59.53">14:59.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there are better ways to do it, but that's the basic idea behind it
* <a href="#15:01.04" id="15:01.04">15:01.04 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: you could also inherit from SafeTransport and do if url.startswith('https'): self.open(url); else: Transport.open(self, url) (not sure if that works though)
* <a href="#15:02.58" id="15:02.58">15:02.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah yeah. thanks
* <a href="#15:04.05" id="15:04.05">15:04.05 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Then I assume I can elf.safe_transport.send_data = self.send_data so I can override the method in the safe_transport class
* <a href="#15:06.13" id="15:06.13">15:06.13 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: this is what I am working on <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/default/tree/scripts/schema-dump.py>
* <a href="#15:06.57" id="15:06.57">15:06.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s/send_data/send_content/
* <a href="#15:07.11" id="15:07.11">15:07.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: afk

* <a href="#15:17.33" id="15:17.33">15:17.33 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: you could also use __getattr__ and do something like def __getattr__(self, method, *args, **kwargs): and then decide whether you want to redirect to self.transport or self.safe_transport, but that might be more complicated depending on what exactly you want to do
