# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-11-24
* <a href="#11:51.55" id="11:51.55">11:51.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Pythonistas: jerrykan, taggnostr, bitdancer, cmeerw I have a python problem and my google fu isn't good enough.
* <a href="#11:54.00" id="11:54.00">11:54.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am trying to create a class that inherits from one of 2 base classes at the time it runs init. However if I define the class with two parents, they conflict. I get an error that I can't resolve the order.
* <a href="#11:54.04" id="11:54.04">11:54.04 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: class TestTransport(xmlrpc_.client.Transport, xmlrpc_.client.SafeTransport):
* <a href="#11:54.05" id="11:54.05">11:54.05 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: TypeError: Cannot create a consistent method resolution
* <a href="#11:54.06" id="11:54.06">11:54.06 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: order (MRO) for bases Transport, SafeTransport
* <a href="#11:55.10" id="11:55.10">11:55.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Is there some way for __init__ to say: hey my parent class should be  xmlrpc_.client.SafeTransport when it gets called?
* <a href="#11:55.46" id="11:55.46">11:55.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: The reason I am doing this is I need to parse the URL passed in. If it is an https URL, I use SafeTransport, else I use Transport.
* <a href="#11:57.15" id="11:57.15">11:57.15 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Right now I look at the url in the caller and use either a SafeTransport based class or the Transport based class.
* <a href="#11:58.02" id="11:58.02">11:58.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: google keywords to look for would be helpful, links to how to do this even more so.

* <a href="#12:27.07" id="12:27.07">12:27.07 (EST)</a> - __[cmeerw[m]](https://github.com/cmeerw[m])__: the closest I have found is <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32598363/conditional-class-inheritance-in-python> which seems to be saying it's not possible

* <a href="#12:48.57" id="12:48.57">12:48.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, ok. I did come across some metaclass stuff, but it's causing brain damage as we type.
* <a href="#12:49.49" id="12:49.49">12:49.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also I would like this to work in python2 as well as three, but I can live without that if I need to. Just trying to get super() to play well with p2 and p3 is a pain.
* <a href="#12:50.03" id="12:50.03">12:50.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thanks cmeerw.
* <a href="#12:51.03" id="12:51.03">12:51.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: dynamic class inheritance looked like it might be the right terms, but I am not really making heads or tails of it.
