* <a href="#02:22.22" id="02:22.22">02:22.22 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m], would you have some time to provide feedback on the Roundup docs. Specifically I am going to rewrite the install docs to
* <a href="#02:22.29" id="02:22.29">02:22.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 1) use a virtual environment
* <a href="#02:22.36" id="02:22.36">02:22.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: 2) install using pip
* <a href="#02:22.53" id="02:22.53">02:22.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: rather then the currently documented source install.

* <a href="#02:23.29" id="02:23.29">02:23.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Since you know virtual env and thing better than I do, I thnk your giving it a once over would be useful.
