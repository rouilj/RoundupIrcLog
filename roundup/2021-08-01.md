* <a href="#18:39.48" id="18:39.48">18:39.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin does a list of the results from the Finnish security analysis of pypi exist? I didn't see any data set info referenced in their paper. I like that they used bandit as I have been using it on roundup.
* <a href="#18:55.31" id="18:55.31">18:55.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hello web irc user. Do you have a question?
* <a href="#18:59.02" id="18:59.02">18:59.02 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc45428](https://github.com/qwebirc45428)__: Hello, I'm looking for information on any Roundup development regarding auto-response to emails received into the bug tracker. specifically, on key-words found in the email body or subject fields. I can't imagine this hasnt been attempted to help automation however, I've searched the  sourceforge site but found nothing. Any direction would be appreciated. Thank you.
* <a href="#19:02.08" id="19:02.08">19:02.08 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Sorry I am not sure what you want. Are you looking for roundup to ignore autoresponse (e.g. vacation emails) sent in response to a roundup notification? Are you looking to suppress notifications (autosent emails from roundup) when a user ends an email?
* <a href="#19:03.30" id="19:03.30">19:03.30 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Sounds like you want the latter based on the presence of keywords.
* <a href="#19:05.01" id="19:05.01">19:05.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: sigh. <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/NosyMessagesAllTheTime> does the opposite sort of. But you can change the nosydetector in the tracker's home directory and look
* <a href="#19:07.25" id="19:07.25">19:07.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: at messages and other info in an reactor to not send nosy messages. Alternatively you can set up an auditor that analyses the inbound changenote/email. The auditor can set a "suppress-notification" property (added to the schema) on the message and the nosy reactor can use that info to make the decision on sending a nosy message.
* <a href="#21:29.58" id="21:29.58">21:29.58 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc59794](https://github.com/qwebirc59794)__: Re: automating Roundup - thanks for the response, the scenario I'm looking for, if there is script out there already, is that once an email ticket is received by roundup the software does a key-word search for a specific word in the body and triggers a pre-written email template to the responder using the email in the 'Reply-to' field.
