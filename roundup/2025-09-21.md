# Roundup IRC Log for 2025-09-21
* <a href="#18:55.56" id="18:55.56">18:55.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I added the Roundup github repo clone to deepwiki. Feel free to ask it questions at: <https://deepwiki.com/roundup-tracker/roundup> Seems to be about 75% accurate in its answers. With multiple prompting I have managed to get it up to a 90% solution. If I could incorporate the mailing list and wiki in it's data set it would probably be better.
