* <a href="#11:08.13" id="11:08.13">11:08.13 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, ack. It may be a double encode somewhere then. Check the bytes in the database, database encoding etc. and put together an email with the info is what I suggest. Do you know how the subject (I assume you mean title) was set? Email, web/html, rest, xmlrpc, cli, program?
