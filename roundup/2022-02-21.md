* <a href="#02:45.11" id="02:45.11">02:45.11 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: its postgres in my case
* <a href="#11:08.13" id="11:08.13">11:08.13 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, ack. It may be a double encode somewhere then. Check the bytes in the database, database encoding etc. and put together an email with the info is what I suggest. Do you know how the subject (I assume you mean title) was set? Email, web/html, rest, xmlrpc, cli, program?
* <a href="#12:09.34" id="12:09.34">12:09.34 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also is this reproducible?
* <a href="#12:10.18" id="12:10.18">12:10.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: do you have other examples/words with the same issue?
