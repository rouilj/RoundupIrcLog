Since it's the subject, that is stored in the database. If you are using mysql, there may be an encoding error there. Use the mysql ci to dump the subject for the issue with the problem.
* <a href="#23:58.56" id="23:58.56">23:58.56 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If it looks right in the database, then set a breakpoint in the backend code where the value is retrieved from the database and trace it forward from there.
