# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-11-02
* <a href="#06:31.03" id="06:31.03">06:31.03 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I've stumble upon something Im not really sure howto approach / solve. Im moving from roundup 1.4.20 to 2.x and from python2 to python3. Currently im running roundup 2.0.0 with Python3, and working my way through html/ folder and converting stuff accordingly. Right now im working on user.item.html
* <a href="#06:31.48" id="06:31.48">06:31.48 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: getting a stacktrace about  ('issue', 5000L, 'initiator') from row 180
* <a href="#06:31.55" id="06:31.55">06:31.55 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <tal:block tal:condition="context/id" tal:replace="structure context/history" />
* <a href="#06:32.27" id="06:32.27">06:32.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: reading on the web,  in python2 long integer literals were indicated with an l or L suffix. In Python 3, ints and longs have been merged into just int, which functions pretty much like long used to.
* <a href="#06:33.23" id="06:33.23">06:33.23 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I'm unable to find anything regarding this in the upgrade documentation on roundup website, and I dont know howto approach this.. Would I need to update this directly in postgresql or can it be handle in code?
