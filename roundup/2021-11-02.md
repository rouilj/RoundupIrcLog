# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-11-02
* <a href="#06:31.03" id="06:31.03">06:31.03 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I've stumble upon something Im not really sure howto approach / solve. Im moving from roundup 1.4.20 to 2.x and from python2 to python3. Currently im running roundup 2.0.0 with Python3, and working my way through html/ folder and converting stuff accordingly. Right now im working on user.item.html
* <a href="#06:31.48" id="06:31.48">06:31.48 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: getting a stacktrace about  ('issue', 5000L, 'initiator') from row 180
* <a href="#06:31.55" id="06:31.55">06:31.55 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <tal:block tal:condition="context/id" tal:replace="structure context/history" />
* <a href="#06:32.27" id="06:32.27">06:32.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: reading on the web,  in python2 long integer literals were indicated with an l or L suffix. In Python 3, ints and longs have been merged into just int, which functions pretty much like long used to.
* <a href="#06:33.23" id="06:33.23">06:33.23 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I'm unable to find anything regarding this in the upgrade documentation on roundup website, and I dont know howto approach this.. Would I need to update this directly in postgresql or can it be handle in code?
* <a href="#10:38.40" id="10:38.40">10:38.40 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Just delete the L?  A little hard to say without knowing what the error is you are getting :)
* <a href="#11:16.21" id="11:16.21">11:16.21 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: File "/usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/roundup/anypy/strings.py", line 145, in eval_import
* <a href="#11:16.24" id="11:16.24">11:16.24 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: v = eval(s)
* <a href="#11:16.27" id="11:16.27">11:16.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: File "<string>", line 1
* <a href="#11:16.29" id="11:16.29">11:16.29 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: ('issue', 5027L, 'assignedto')
* <a href="#11:16.31" id="11:16.31">11:16.31 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Templating Error
* <a href="#11:16.31" id="11:16.31">11:16.31 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <class 'SyntaxError'>: invalid syntax (<string>, line 1)
* <a href="#11:16.34" id="11:16.34">11:16.34 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: ^
* <a href="#11:16.36" id="11:16.36">11:16.36 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: SyntaxError: invalid syntax
* <a href="#11:16.41" id="11:16.41">11:16.41 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Debugging information follows
* <a href="#11:16.41" id="11:16.41">11:16.41 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: While evaluating the standard:'context/history' expression on line 180
* <a href="#11:33.54" id="11:33.54">11:33.54 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: Ah, OK, so that isn't hardcoded in your template.  It's been too long since I dug in to the templates for me to suggest where that might be coming from.  Grepping your html source for "L" will probably get too many hits :(  Can you trace back where the evaled string is coming from?
* <a href="#11:34.10" id="11:34.10">11:34.10 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: But I was right, fundamentally the goal is to get rid of that L.
