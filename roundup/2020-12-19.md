It should enable more people to run the tests even if they have no previous experience with pytest, which is generally considered A Good Thing (TM)...
* <a href="#09:25.59" id="09:25.59">09:25.59 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: sounds good. I think `python3 -m pytest test/` is the most reliable of the options you mentioned.

* <a href="#12:00.05" id="12:00.05">12:00.05 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: lmsteffan, the best way to do it is to have run_tests.py working so nobody needs to install pytest but as you have proven that's not a sustainable option 8-(.
* <a href="#12:00.28" id="12:00.28">12:00.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so thanks for the thumbs up on the proposal.
