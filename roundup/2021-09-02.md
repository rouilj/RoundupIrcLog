* <a href="#03:18.24" id="03:18.24">03:18.24 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: Trying to implement a util function, perhaps this is abit out of scope for what is to be discussed in here, but I get templating error
* <a href="#03:18.27" id="03:18.27">03:18.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <class 'KeyError'>: 'No such property "times" on sa'
* <a href="#03:18.59" id="03:18.59">03:18.59 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Do I need to register my arbitrary variable from the utilfunction on my class i schema.py ?
* <a href="#03:19.48" id="03:19.48">03:19.48 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I basically just copyied over what you linked about totalTimeSpent but just modified it to return a static string for testing purpose
* <a href="#03:33.43" id="03:33.43">03:33.43 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: nomicon: you shouldn't need to add anything to the `schema.py` file, but you do need to register the util. You can see at the bottom of the file  the `init()` function registering the utils.
* <a href="#03:33.56" id="03:33.56">03:33.56 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: jerrykan[m]: yeah I've done that..
