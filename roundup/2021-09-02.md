# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-09-02
* <a href="#03:18.24" id="03:18.24">03:18.24 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: Trying to implement a util function, perhaps this is abit out of scope for what is to be discussed in here, but I get templating error
* <a href="#03:18.27" id="03:18.27">03:18.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: <class 'KeyError'>: 'No such property "times" on sa'
* <a href="#03:18.59" id="03:18.59">03:18.59 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Do I need to register my arbitrary variable from the utilfunction on my class i schema.py ?
* <a href="#03:19.48" id="03:19.48">03:19.48 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I basically just copyied over what you linked about totalTimeSpent but just modified it to return a static string for testing purpose
* <a href="#03:33.43" id="03:33.43">03:33.43 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: nomicon: you shouldn't need to add anything to the `schema.py` file, but you do need to register the util. You can see at the bottom of the file  the `init()` function registering the utils.
* <a href="#03:33.56" id="03:33.56">03:33.56 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: jerrykan[m]: yeah I've done that..
* <a href="#09:05.10" id="09:05.10">09:05.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon I assume you restarted roundup as well correct?
* <a href="#09:07.51" id="09:07.51">09:07.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also I am not sure what sa or times are. Your function when registered should be utils.mumble() where you defined the function as "def mumble():" Also you have to put the file in the extensions subdirectory of your tracker. It doesn't go into the schema file at all.
* <a href="#09:37.18" id="09:37.18">09:37.18 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: yeah its restarted. I guess times comes from Step 5 in <https://roundup.sourceforge.io/docs/customizing.html#adding-a-time-log-to-your-issues>
* <a href="#09:44.01" id="09:44.01">09:44.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: oh ... did you implement the whole example? I pointed you to that as an example to write and register a utility function you write. You shouldn't have time in your function at all.
* <a href="#09:44.46" id="09:44.46">09:44.46 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I just reused the tal elements, but the actual code in the utility file is different.. right now it just returns a static string as test
* <a href="#10:07.27" id="10:07.27">10:07.27 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: *facepalm* never mind that =)
* <a href="#10:32.58" id="10:32.58">10:32.58 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I have a html (sa.index.html) that lists customer support agreements. These comes from a class called 'sa'. The specification for 'sa' is validfrom, validto, admincontact and a few more... I'd like to also have the email address for admincontact in that list.  admincontact is a  <roundup.hyperdb.Link to "user">, so I need to to somewhow output the value of user.address
* <a href="#10:35.10" id="10:35.10">10:35.10 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: with roundup-admin this could be done with 'roundup-admin get admincontact sa10', which would output 13, and then to get the email 'roundup-admin get address user13'
* <a href="#10:35.35" id="10:35.35">10:35.35 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: i've done it with bash+roundup-admin already. but would also like to have it in the web gui
* <a href="#10:39.22" id="10:39.22">10:39.22 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I've tried a few different approaches, tal:content with some inline python:db._db.user.filter_sql to select the address from _user, but then I never managed to properly pass the admincontact as a variable in the sql, and also tried that utility function, but never managed to pass an input variable neither :/
* <a href="#10:41.21" id="10:41.21">10:41.21 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: not really sure if im any good at explaning this =)
* <a href="#11:08.57" id="11:08.57">11:08.57 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume this is in an index where you are iterating using batch over all active items in the sa class.  If you are outputting the contact using i.admincontact.plain(), you can output the address using tal:content="python:i.admincontact.address.plain(). Similarly tal:content="i/contact" goes to tal:content="i/contact/address"
* <a href="#11:09.31" id="11:09.31">11:09.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: sorry on the path expression it should be admincontact not contact.
* <a href="#11:20.36" id="11:20.36">11:20.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You can also use i/admincontact/address/plain to force it to be plain text. It is by default IIRC, but you can force it as well.
* <a href="#11:21.46" id="11:21.46">11:21.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't see any reason for invoking sql here at all. In general use the hyperdb and forget that there is an RDBMS underlying the tracker.
* <a href="#11:23.10" id="11:23.10">11:23.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Generally filter is meant to return sets of values IIRC. Something like: find all users with the role Admin or with the role Developer. Or find all sa's that expire in the next 2 months.
* <a href="#11:23.46" id="11:23.46">11:23.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon above for you, but i guess you have headed home for the night.
* <a href="#11:23.56" id="11:23.56">11:23.56 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: afk
