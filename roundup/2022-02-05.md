* <a href="#19:59.49" id="19:59.49">19:59.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] did you ever take a look into what the setuptools replacement is for 'from distutils.command.build import build as base'  or 'from distutils.command import build'? I managed to replace all other distutil imports except these two in roundup/dist/**.
* <a href="#20:04.43" id="20:04.43">20:04.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: maybe setuptools.command.build_py import build_py as base and  setuptools.command import build_py as build??
