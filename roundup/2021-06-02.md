* <a href="#04:26.39" id="04:26.39">04:26.39 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: I'd be happy to provide you with some stats from our roundup installation. Please be aware Im totally noob on this. I just started this job a few months ago, and I've never used roundup before, so its all new to me.
* <a href="#04:26.50" id="04:26.50">04:26.50 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I think we've been using roundup atleast since 2012.
* <a href="#04:28.54" id="04:28.54">04:28.54 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: bash-4.1$ roundup-admin -i /var/lib/roundup/trackers/XYZ list issue | wc -l

* <a href="#04:28.54" id="04:28.54">04:28.54 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: bash-4.1$ roundup-admin -i /var/lib/roundup/trackers/XYZ list user | wc -l
* <a href="#04:28.54" id="04:28.54">04:28.54 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: 7720
* <a href="#04:29.06" id="04:29.06">04:29.06 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I hope that's the correct way to count issues and users =)
* <a href="#04:33.12" id="04:33.12">04:33.12 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: regarding Marking issue as spam, what it does is nothing more than retire the issue and initiator, then there are some background stuff on the server that will move the mail to a Maildir folder, and spamassassin sa-learn will learn it a spam
* <a href="#16:52.13" id="16:52.13">16:52.13 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, nice I like those integrations. The wiki has a link to an irc notifier but not slack. Would be interested to see how your issue merge compares to <https://wiki.roundup-tracker.org/MergeIssues>. We have spambayes integratin discussed on the wiki prior to it being comitted. bugs.python.org developed it.
* <a href="#16:53.34" id="16:53.34">16:53.34 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: We also have a couple of ldap integration examples on the wiki as well. Would be interested to see how they compare to your implementation.
* <a href="#16:55.53" id="16:55.53">16:55.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon have you tried reading the roundup docs at www.roundup-tracker.org? Sadly it's a bit like drinking from a firehose. It could use a more structured beginner developer doc. The customizing doc has a lot of info, but it's easy to miss things.
* <a href="#16:58.46" id="16:58.46">16:58.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: For stats, since issue id's and user id's are in order, the max value you see is usually what you need. The one time that fails is when numbering doesn't start at 1 because a previous system's tickets were imported and they wanted to preserve the id numbers (e.g. <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org> has large numbers because the tickerts were imported from sourceforge).
