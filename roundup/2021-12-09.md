* <a href="#13:47.44" id="13:47.44">13:47.44 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] did you get your git-remote-hg setup fixed? I am pushing your changes to roundup-demo to load the config_ini.ini file now and will put a fix to properly recognize the minimal template shortly.
* <a href="#18:43.44" id="18:43.44">18:43.44 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: I haven't tried using `git-remote-hg` in a while. Happy for you to push the changes if they are still relevant.
* <a href="#19:04.43" id="19:04.43">19:04.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ack. I made couple of changes. There is a place where the template is turned into  template_path I moved that before you load config_ini.ini and used the template_path rather than the template. But your code handled the hard part. Also I stripped the template to it's basepath to match to "minimal". Also threw in two tests that failed prior to the patches and succeeded after.
* <a href="#19:04.53" id="19:04.53">19:04.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: So it should be happier now.
* <a href="#19:05.18" id="19:05.18">19:05.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also managed to take out some obsolete code too. So more wins.
* <a href="#19:06.00" id="19:06.00">19:06.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I hope Santa brings you a working git-remote-hg. Have a very merry bah humbug 8-).
