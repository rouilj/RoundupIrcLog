* <a href="#08:58.13" id="08:58.13">08:58.13 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I wonder if an export/import using roundup-admin is needed here. Posting this to the roundup-users mailing list with the details on the before and after states (python version, roundup version, database versions) and the steps you did  is your bet bet. I seem to recall some work done on export/import to normalize the export and it may have included removing the L tag on integers.
