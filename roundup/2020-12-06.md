* <a href="#22:28.41" id="22:28.41">22:28.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] I deployed uuptime to my own github repo and I would like to create a repo under the roundup-tracker user. See: https://rouilj.github.io/RoundupAssets/  I still have a couple of bugs to work out, but do you have any objections?
* <a href="#22:31.58" id="22:31.58">22:31.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am still working on figuring out how notifications work. Uuptime generates issues and I am working out where notifications go by default and assign some sites to particular people who I hope do not have to be admins of the roundup-tracker user.

* <a href="#23:51.04" id="23:51.04">23:51.04 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think I do. The one issue is that I can't generate a personal access token (PAT). The way I did that for my account was to clink on my avatar at the top right and choose settings/security/developer settings. However since I am not logged in as the roundup-tracker user I can't do that. Also it's not clear to me that the roundup-tracker "user" has the ability to generate a PAT.
* <a href="#23:52.12" id="23:52.12">23:52.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think I can create secrets in the repo etc. My plan was to transfer the repo from roulj -> roundup-tracker. I think that should work (perhaps with having to re-create secrets).
