See: https://rouilj.github.io/RoundupAssets/  I still have a couple of bugs to work out, but do you have any objections?

Uuptime generates issues and I am working out where notifications go by default and assign some sites to particular people who I hope do not have to be admins of the roundup-tracker user.
