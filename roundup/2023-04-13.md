* <a href="#14:47.25" id="14:47.25">14:47.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] just a followup, it seems my changes to travis ci worked. codecov is reporting data from travis.However I still do not have permissions to view/set settings on the roundup-tracker/roundup page in travis-ci.

* <a href="#20:09.04" id="20:09.04">20:09.04 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: I had a bit of a look in the Travis CI settings but couldn't find a way to add new users. I assume it is based on GitHub repo/group membership?
