* <a href="#22:07.29" id="22:07.29">22:07.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan thanks for the notice. I updated my docs. I wonder if I should put the github setup/update info into the developer docs.
* <a href="#22:07.50" id="22:07.50">22:07.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: thoughts?
* <a href="#22:11.39" id="22:11.39">22:11.39 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: If it is helpful for you it might be worthwhile. My `git-hg-remote` has been broken for a rather long time, and roundup was the only project I interact that uses Mercurial. I only contribute the occasional patch, so it hasn't been a high priority to fix.
