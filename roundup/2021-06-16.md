* <a href="#21:27.25" id="21:27.25">21:27.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, EWDurbin, it turns out compression isn't enabled in nginx for the roundup (and I assume other) trackers. I would like to turn it on, but I think doing so requires a reload of nginx which is a shared resource. I plan on modifying the roundup nginx config and doing a hot reload with 'systemctl reload nginx' or 'nginx -s reload' but I probably need to coordinate this with somebody. Who would be the person to coordinate wit
