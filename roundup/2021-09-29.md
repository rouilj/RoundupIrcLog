# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-09-29
* <a href="#17:40.13" id="17:40.13">17:40.13 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, is there an API to access msg/file contents?
* <a href="#17:41.23" id="17:41.23">17:41.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: by looking at the msg attrs I see a summary that seems to include the first line of the message, a content that is set to None, and no filename
* <a href="#17:42.52" id="17:42.52">17:42.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: the actual content seems to be stored in db/files/msg/0/msgN, but the path is not included in the attrs, so I guess there should be a function to either return the path from the msg id or to return the content directly
* <a href="#17:50.25" id="17:50.25">17:50.25 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: nevermind, DB.msg.get(msg_id, 'content') seems to do the trick, even if the content is set to None while printing the msg attrs (maybe it's retrieved lazily)
* <a href="#17:55.07" id="17:55.07">17:55.07 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct.
* <a href="#17:56.31" id="17:56.31">17:56.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you never access the file directly, it's hidden under the hyperdb. (In fact it could be in the database, be compressed or encrypted depending on how the msg class is modified).
* <a href="#19:53.56" id="19:53.56">19:53.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, thanks
* <a href="#20:42.32" id="20:42.32">20:42.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Are you cloning messages into github issues?
* <a href="#20:42.56" id="20:42.56">20:42.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yep, working on the export/import
