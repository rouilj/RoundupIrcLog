# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-09-29
* <a href="#17:40.13" id="17:40.13">17:40.13 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, is there an API to access msg/file contents?
* <a href="#17:41.23" id="17:41.23">17:41.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: by looking at the msg attrs I see a summary that seems to include the first line of the message, a content that is set to None, and no filename
* <a href="#17:42.52" id="17:42.52">17:42.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: the actual content seems to be stored in db/files/msg/0/msgN, but the path is not included in the attrs, so I guess there should be a function to either return the path from the msg id or to return the content directly
