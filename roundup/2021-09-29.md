# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-09-29
* <a href="#17:40.13" id="17:40.13">17:40.13 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, is there an API to access msg/file contents?
* <a href="#17:41.23" id="17:41.23">17:41.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: by looking at the msg attrs I see a summary that seems to include the first line of the message, a content that is set to None, and no filename
* <a href="#17:42.52" id="17:42.52">17:42.52 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: the actual content seems to be stored in db/files/msg/0/msgN, but the path is not included in the attrs, so I guess there should be a function to either return the path from the msg id or to return the content directly
* <a href="#17:50.25" id="17:50.25">17:50.25 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: nevermind, DB.msg.get(msg_id, 'content') seems to do the trick, even if the content is set to None while printing the msg attrs (maybe it's retrieved lazily)
* <a href="#17:55.07" id="17:55.07">17:55.07 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: correct.
* <a href="#17:56.31" id="17:56.31">17:56.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you never access the file directly, it's hidden under the hyperdb. (In fact it could be in the database, be compressed or encrypted depending on how the msg class is modified).
* <a href="#19:53.56" id="19:53.56">19:53.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, thanks
* <a href="#20:42.32" id="20:42.32">20:42.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Are you cloning messages into github issues?
* <a href="#20:42.56" id="20:42.56">20:42.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yep, working on the export/import
* <a href="#21:03.29" id="21:03.29">21:03.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Would it be easier to use the export format?
* <a href="#21:04.25" id="21:04.25">21:04.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, would it be be easier to use the export format? Not sure the disk space is available, but that's what I did for one conversion years ago.
* <a href="#21:07.56" id="21:07.56">21:07.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, GitHub wants an archive with some json files, so I'm getting the data out of the DB, converting them, and writing them in the json files
* <a href="#21:14.57" id="21:14.57">21:14.57 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah ok. Is your exporter generic enough to include as an example in roundup?
* <a href="#21:16.21" id="21:16.21">21:16.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: We have a couple of scripts for moving from other trackers to roundup. Might be good to include a move away from roundup script too so people realize roundup doesn't lock your data in.
* <a href="#21:22.59" id="21:22.59">21:22.59 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, the GitHub format apparently is proprietary and they might abandon it soon, so it won't be useful for exporting to GitHub and I can't make the script public
* <a href="#21:23.50" id="21:23.50">21:23.50 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: maybe the export part could be reused but most of the code is just converting all the fields and rearranging them to match github's format
* <a href="#21:50.19" id="21:50.19">21:50.19 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ack. I am surprised the format is private. I would expect it to be public so people could move to it.
* <a href="#21:51.17" id="21:51.17">21:51.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hopefully they continue to support an export format so your data isn't locked up.
* <a href="#21:57.37" id="21:57.37">21:57.37 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there are some public GitHub APIs, but we are using some enterprise tools/APIs
