# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-11-03
* <a href="#10:23.32" id="10:23.32">10:23.32 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: is this anything you've stumbled upon before?
* <a href="#14:09.33" id="14:09.33">14:09.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, since it's looking at the history, I wonder if there was an integer field changed. This vaguely rings a bell.
* <a href="#14:10.06" id="14:10.06">14:10.06 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: can you write this up for the mailing list and see if this rings a bell for anybody there.
* <a href="#14:13.49" id="14:13.49">14:13.49 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also how did you get the data from the older to the new instance?
* <a href="#14:16.09" id="14:16.09">14:16.09 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I am trying to figure out how tal history display is getting to eval_import
* <a href="#14:18.34" id="14:18.34">14:18.34 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hyperdb only calls eval_import during an actual import op using roundup-admin.
