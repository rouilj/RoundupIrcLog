* <a href="#19:28.10" id="19:28.10">19:28.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: HedgeMage do you have any experience with fuzzing? I have wanted to doe some fuzzing on roundup but don't know how to instrument the python code etc. Read: <https://adalogics.com/blog/fuzzing-100-open-source-projects-with-oss-fuzz> and thought I'd reach out to a few people for ideas.
