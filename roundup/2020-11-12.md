* <a id="19:38.32">19:38.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr how goes the migration?
* <a id="19:38.49">19:38.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: slowly :)
* <a id="19:38.58">19:38.58 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: https://github.com/psf/gh-migration/projects/1
* <a id="19:39.32">19:39.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: looking. Also I migrated logging for this channel to fossil as well and that gives us text search capacity (of a sort).
* <a id="19:40.16">19:40.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "Find a tool able to handle CLAs." what's a CLA?
* <a id="19:43.36">19:43.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ugh. Yeah number is going to be an issue. Maybe just remap every issue to a new set of numbers higher in the food chain. You have to change the text of the messages to keep the mapping. Does github support linking directly to messages?
* <a id="19:47.57">19:47.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hmm, I wonder if: https://github.com/schlatterbeck/trackersync this may be helpful? Sort of replay all tracker messages, issues etc. through it and convert into github??
* <a id="19:48.54">19:48.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: It's meant for real time sync not batch move though. Also git issues isn;t one of it's supported remotes but maybe something useful there?
* <a id="20:05.44">20:05.44 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, the CLA is the contributor licence agreement, there is a cla-bot but doesn't support signing from a company (i.e. the company signs the agreement and all its employees can contribute without having to sign individually)
* <a id="20:05.58">20:05.58 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there is an issue linked in the readme about it
* <a id="20:07.30">20:07.30 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: exporting shouldn't be too difficult, I still have to hear from github what format they want, but it should just be a matter of getting the data out of roundup and into a json (or something similar) with the right structure
* <a id="20:08.42">20:08.42 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I didn't find any api documentation, but it should be the same as the xmlrpc one, right?
* <a id="20:09.09">20:09.09 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I used it already in the weekly summary report script
* <a id="20:11.58">20:11.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: rest api, python api??
* <a id="20:13.24">20:13.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: what you may want to do is export the database to flat csv files and reparse those into what you feed github.
* <a id="20:14.02">20:14.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: roundup-admin export. The one issue with that is it's all or nothing. No incremental exporting
* <a id="20:16.17">20:16.17 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: import_sf.py (in the top level scripts directory) uses the import/export file format for doing the import.
* <a id="20:16.21">20:16.21 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: does roundup-admin export exports to csv?
* <a id="20:16.55">20:16.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yes plus files for msgs, attachments (files) etc.
* <a id="20:17.01">20:17.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: https://github.com/psf/bpo-tracker-cpython/blob/master/scripts/roundup-summary#L779-L780
* <a id="20:17.11">20:17.11 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I was thinking to do something like this
* <a id="20:17.49">20:17.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: then you can do DB.issue to access the issues and their data
* <a id="20:17.53">20:17.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah that would work as well.
* <a id="20:18.25">20:18.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: using the roundup python API should be fine.
* <a id="20:18.49">20:18.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: you raised a good point about attachments, I had forgot about them now that we don't use patches anymore
* <a id="20:19.16">20:19.16 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: tomorrow I have another meeting with github, so I'll ask them about that too
* <a id="20:19.31">20:19.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Well I would expect screenshots, example programs exposing issue etc. would al be attachments.
* <a id="20:19.39">20:19.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s/al/all/
* <a id="20:20.13">20:20.13 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yes, but we mostly have .diff, not many screenshots or other files
* <a id="20:22.00">20:22.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume you would want to preserve those for historic accuracy, but maybe not.
* <a id="20:23.25">20:23.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't have a copy of your tracker anymore (had checked out a copy when I was helping you with the upgrade) so I can't easily look for other edges.
* <a id="20:23.53">20:23.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I want to preserve as much as possible
* <a id="20:24.30">20:24.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Yeah including internal links.
* <a id="20:25.07">20:25.07 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: that shouldn't be difficult to fix
* <a id="20:25.48">20:25.48 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I mean, keeping the files linked to the right issue is easy, and links like #12345 can be easily rewritten to match the new number
* <a id="20:26.40">20:26.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Right a simple dict for each of msgs, files, issues etc. will do.
