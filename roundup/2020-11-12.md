# Roundup IRC Log for 2020-11-12
* <a href="#19:38.32" id="19:38.32">19:38.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr how goes the migration?
* <a href="#19:38.49" id="19:38.49">19:38.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: slowly :)
* <a href="#19:38.58" id="19:38.58">19:38.58 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: https://github.com/psf/gh-migration/projects/1
* <a href="#19:39.32" id="19:39.32">19:39.32 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: looking. Also I migrated logging for this channel to fossil as well and that gives us text search capacity (of a sort).
* <a href="#19:40.16" id="19:40.16">19:40.16 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "Find a tool able to handle CLAs." what's a CLA?
* <a href="#19:43.36" id="19:43.36">19:43.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ugh. Yeah number is going to be an issue. Maybe just remap every issue to a new set of numbers higher in the food chain. You have to change the text of the messages to keep the mapping. Does github support linking directly to messages?
* <a href="#19:47.57" id="19:47.57">19:47.57 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hmm, I wonder if: https://github.com/schlatterbeck/trackersync this may be helpful? Sort of replay all tracker messages, issues etc. through it and convert into github??
* <a href="#19:48.54" id="19:48.54">19:48.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: It's meant for real time sync not batch move though. Also git issues isn;t one of it's supported remotes but maybe something useful there?
* <a href="#20:05.44" id="20:05.44">20:05.44 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, the CLA is the contributor licence agreement, there is a cla-bot but doesn't support signing from a company (i.e. the company signs the agreement and all its employees can contribute without having to sign individually)
* <a href="#20:05.58" id="20:05.58">20:05.58 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: there is an issue linked in the readme about it
* <a href="#20:07.30" id="20:07.30">20:07.30 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: exporting shouldn't be too difficult, I still have to hear from github what format they want, but it should just be a matter of getting the data out of roundup and into a json (or something similar) with the right structure
* <a href="#20:08.42" id="20:08.42">20:08.42 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I didn't find any api documentation, but it should be the same as the xmlrpc one, right?
* <a href="#20:09.09" id="20:09.09">20:09.09 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I used it already in the weekly summary report script
* <a href="#20:11.58" id="20:11.58">20:11.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: rest api, python api??
* <a href="#20:13.24" id="20:13.24">20:13.24 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: what you may want to do is export the database to flat csv files and reparse those into what you feed github.
* <a href="#20:14.02" id="20:14.02">20:14.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: roundup-admin export. The one issue with that is it's all or nothing. No incremental exporting
* <a href="#20:16.17" id="20:16.17">20:16.17 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: import_sf.py (in the top level scripts directory) uses the import/export file format for doing the import.
* <a href="#20:16.21" id="20:16.21">20:16.21 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: does roundup-admin export exports to csv?
* <a href="#20:16.55" id="20:16.55">20:16.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yes plus files for msgs, attachments (files) etc.
* <a href="#20:17.01" id="20:17.01">20:17.01 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: https://github.com/psf/bpo-tracker-cpython/blob/master/scripts/roundup-summary#L779-L780
* <a href="#20:17.11" id="20:17.11">20:17.11 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I was thinking to do something like this
* <a href="#20:17.49" id="20:17.49">20:17.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: then you can do DB.issue to access the issues and their data
* <a href="#20:17.53" id="20:17.53">20:17.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah that would work as well.
* <a href="#20:18.25" id="20:18.25">20:18.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: using the roundup python API should be fine.
* <a href="#20:18.49" id="20:18.49">20:18.49 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: you raised a good point about attachments, I had forgot about them now that we don't use patches anymore
* <a href="#20:19.16" id="20:19.16">20:19.16 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: tomorrow I have another meeting with github, so I'll ask them about that too
* <a href="#20:19.31" id="20:19.31">20:19.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Well I would expect screenshots, example programs exposing issue etc. would al be attachments.
* <a href="#20:19.39" id="20:19.39">20:19.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s/al/all/
* <a href="#20:20.13" id="20:20.13">20:20.13 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yes, but we mostly have .diff, not many screenshots or other files
* <a href="#20:22.00" id="20:22.00">20:22.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume you would want to preserve those for historic accuracy, but maybe not.
* <a href="#20:23.25" id="20:23.25">20:23.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I don't have a copy of your tracker anymore (had checked out a copy when I was helping you with the upgrade) so I can't easily look for other edges.
* <a href="#20:23.53" id="20:23.53">20:23.53 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I want to preserve as much as possible
* <a href="#20:24.30" id="20:24.30">20:24.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Yeah including internal links.
* <a href="#20:25.07" id="20:25.07">20:25.07 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: that shouldn't be difficult to fix
* <a href="#20:25.48" id="20:25.48">20:25.48 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I mean, keeping the files linked to the right issue is easy, and links like #12345 can be easily rewritten to match the new number
* <a href="#20:26.40" id="20:26.40">20:26.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Right a simple dict for each of msgs, files, issues etc. will do.
* <a href="#21:24.29" id="21:24.29">21:24.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, are the browser use stats for the b.p.o tracker published anywhere? I was looking for the breakdown of mobile vs desktop use. I suspect desktop is still the king since most people coming there are producers of content and not consumers. Also producing content usualy requires more computer interactions than you would want to do on mobile.
* <a href="#21:25.10" id="21:25.10">21:25.10 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I don't know if we have any stats about it, maybe EWDurbin knows?
* <a href="#21:45.15" id="21:45.15">21:45.15 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: rouilj, are there default fields on top of these? https://github.com/psf/bpo-tracker-cpython/blob/master/schema.py#L183-L205
* <a href="#21:45.38" id="21:45.38">21:45.38 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: I assume date, author, history, anything else?
* <a href="#21:53.28" id="21:53.28">21:53.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ## Class: issue
* <a href="#21:53.28" id="21:53.28">21:53.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: # Default class properties:
* <a href="#21:53.28" id="21:53.28">21:53.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: #   creation = Date()
* <a href="#21:53.28" id="21:53.28">21:53.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: #   activity = Date()
* <a href="#21:53.29" id="21:53.29">21:53.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: #   creator = Link('user')
* <a href="#21:53.29" id="21:53.29">21:53.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: #   actor = Link('user')
* <a href="#21:54.25" id="21:54.25">21:54.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also msg and file classes get:
* <a href="#21:54.26" id="21:54.26">21:54.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ## Class: msg
* <a href="#21:54.26" id="21:54.26">21:54.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: # FileClass automatically gets this property in addition to the Class ones:
* <a href="#21:54.26" id="21:54.26">21:54.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: #   content = String()    [saved to disk in <tracker home>/db/files/]
* <a href="#21:54.26" id="21:54.26">21:54.26 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: #   type = String()       [MIME type of the content, default 'text/plain']
* <a href="#21:56.41" id="21:56.41">21:56.41 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: what is the actor for?
* <a href="#21:56.51" id="21:56.51">21:56.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the person who last changed the item.
* <a href="#21:57.20" id="21:57.20">21:57.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think that's generic for all classes. I thought there was a command in roundup-admin that could be used to show all the fields.
* <a href="#21:57.51" id="21:57.51">21:57.51 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: yep, but I don't have a local instance set up to test it
* <a href="#21:58.11" id="21:58.11">21:58.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: for name in 'creation activity creator actor'.split():
* <a href="#21:58.11" id="21:58.11">21:58.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if name in properties:
* <a href="#21:58.11" id="21:58.11">21:58.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: raise ValueError('"creation", "activity", "creator" and '
* <a href="#21:58.11" id="21:58.11">21:58.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: '"actor" are reserved')
* <a href="#21:58.30" id="21:58.30">21:58.30 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so it is part of eveything derived from class Class in hyperdb.py.
* <a href="#21:58.53" id="21:58.53">21:58.53 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: none of those can be set by the user.
* <a href="#22:00.20" id="22:00.20">22:00.20 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you use roundup-admin exporttables I think you see all the fields.
* <a href="#22:00.43" id="22:00.43">22:00.43 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: thanks :)
* <a href="#22:01.58" id="22:01.58">22:01.58 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: self.cls.getprops(protected=1).items()
* <a href="#22:02.12" id="22:02.12">22:02.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think is what you need to call.
* <a href="#22:04.07" id="22:04.07">22:04.07 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: oh also there is an id prop (duh)
* <a href="#22:04.41" id="22:04.41">22:04.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: they protected props are defined in the backends. rdbms.py defines as:
* <a href="#22:04.49" id="22:04.49">22:04.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if protected:
* <a href="#22:04.49" id="22:04.49">22:04.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: d['id'] = String()

* <a href="#22:20.31" id="22:20.31">22:20.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr: https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551103 I will miss when you guys are not using roundup. It leads to a lot of improvements.
