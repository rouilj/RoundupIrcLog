* <a href="#02:11.38" id="02:11.38">02:11.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] ah github/gitlab confusion on my part. The reason I asked i that travis ci is becoming problematic and I am looking for a new CI platform.
* <a href="#02:14.13" id="02:14.13">02:14.13 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: It should be fairly straight forward to port a TravisCI yaml file to a GitLab CI one.
* <a href="#02:15.16" id="02:15.16">02:15.16 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I set up a GitLab mirror a while ago (for no particular reason). If you have a GitLab account I can give you access. <https://gitlab.com/roundup/roundup>
