* <a href="#12:32.45" id="12:32.45">12:32.45 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: When launching the tests through run_tests.py under Python 3.9, it raises an AssertionError... "warn about missing assertion". When under Python3.8, it raises a series of RuntimeError: generator raised StopIteration
* <a href="#12:51.36" id="12:51.36">12:51.36 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: Furthermore, running "python3.9 demo.py" raises "AttributeError: module 'base64' has no attribute 'decodestring'". As a matter of fact, decodestring has been deprecated and this is taken into account in some parts of the code but not all.
* <a href="#12:55.51" id="12:55.51">12:55.51 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: Advice requested! I am willing to provide a patch to solve the last problem (decodestring and encodestring stuff), basically by duplicating the correct handling which is already performed in some places, but I am unsure whether it's the best way.
