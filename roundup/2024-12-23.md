# Roundup IRC Log for 2024-12-23
* <a href="#09:11.40" id="09:11.40">09:11.40 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: "Can you tell me if there is a session and/or otk table and what type the session.session_time and otk.otk_time fields in the database are." sorry didn't see this. session_time data type is "real". is that the value you're looking for?
* <a href="#09:12.31" id="09:12.31">09:12.31 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: otk_time is "real" as well

* <a href="#09:14.48" id="09:14.48">09:14.48 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: the only indexer options i see in config.ini right now are "indexer_stopwords"

* <a href="#09:16.27" id="09:16.27">09:16.27 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: and i have followup question. i've completed the upgrade steps up to 1.4.21 per this doc. <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading-history.html#migrating-from-1-4-20-to-1-4-21> this leg is the last leg i see on the legacy upgrade page.

* <a href="#09:17.10" id="09:17.10">09:17.10 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: and then the next leg i see on the main upgrade page is 1.5.0 to 1.5.1. <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html#migrating-from-1-5-0-to-1-5-1>
* <a href="#09:17.40" id="09:17.40">09:17.40 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i don't see the process from 1.4.21 to 1.5.0. am i missing something?

* <a href="#10:13.50" id="10:13.50">10:13.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hi randy_. Yes, real was what I wanted. Interesting.....

* <a href="#10:15.25" id="10:15.25">10:15.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: for 1.4.21 to 1.5.0, there were no changes that needed to happen AFAICT.
* <a href="#10:15.43" id="10:15.43">10:15.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so you can start with the 1.5.0->... change series.

* <a href="#10:34.03" id="10:34.03">10:34.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ it looks like we do need to convert the session_time field from real to float. So you will need to write the migration command in the mssqlserver backends once we get to the 2.0.0 -> 2.4 conversion. We can forget about it till then.

* <a href="#10:36.13" id="10:36.13">10:36.13 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: sweet! thanks man. i trudge onward
* <a href="#10:36.41" id="10:36.41">10:36.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: *rouilj hands a walking staff to randy_*
* <a href="#10:36.59" id="10:36.59">10:36.59 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: how have the directions been so far? places where they were confusing?
* <a href="#10:37.00" id="10:37.00">10:37.00 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: lol

* <a href="#10:37.46" id="10:37.46">10:37.46 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: i think they're as clear as they can be. you just need to read carefully.

* <a href="#10:39.37" id="10:39.37">10:39.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: any particularly tricky situations? We can reword unclear segments. IIRC we have had a few rewrites of some upgrade instructions. Since the developers write the upgrade instructions as part of the patch that requires the instruction, they often make sense to us because we are so close to them.

* <a href="#10:40.18" id="10:40.18">10:40.18 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Adding clarifying statements is always good.
* <a href="#10:40.40" id="10:40.40">10:40.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also upgrading isn't difficult but it is a bit picky...

* <a href="#10:46.09" id="10:46.09">10:46.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: randy_ to clarify on indexer in config.ini. You see the indexer property but it is unset correct?

* <a href="#10:48.00" id="10:48.00">10:48.00 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also if you can check your source/development areas. I am wondering if somebody converted test_postgresql.py to test_mssqlserver.py. It would be nice to have tests for the mssqlserver code.

* <a href="#10:51.25" id="10:51.25">10:51.25 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also when you get to 1.6.1 you will want/need to change your python version to the latest 2.7 windows release you can find. You will want a tool called 2to3 to be included in your python2 distribution. I think you are using 2.5.something currently which doesn't have the 2to3 tool AFAIK.

* <a href="#10:53.12" id="10:53.12">10:53.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: over the weekend I put together a local mindmap for your upgrade with 4 milestones on it. I can export it to an outline or something and put it on the wiki if you want a reference.

* <a href="#15:26.31" id="15:26.31">15:26.31 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: ok i have a question. you may not get back to me in time, i'm leaving for the holiday and i may not be back til after new year. in which case, merry christmas and happy new year, and thank you for the effort you've lent me.

* <a href="#15:26.53" id="15:26.53">15:26.53 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: for the question: i'm at <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html#enhancement-to-check-command-for-permissions> but i can't tell what file it's referring to. do you know?
