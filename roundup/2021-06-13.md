# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-13
* <a href="#18:02.27" id="18:02.27">18:02.27 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: FYI I'm trying to install roundup from HEAD but not having too much luck - setuptools complained that I was trying to install to somewhere not on PYTHONPATH, so I added it there, then roundup-admin failed with "pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'roundup==2.0.0' distribution was not found and is required by the application"
* <a href="#18:03.39" id="18:03.39">18:03.39 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I think this is a bit of a sideshow as I can munge things for 2.0, so happy to try anything quick that seems worthwhile, but otherwise I guess I'll drop that for now. I think I could also share our export with you if you wanted to try it out yourself.
