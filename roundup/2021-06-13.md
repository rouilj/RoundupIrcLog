# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-13
* <a href="#18:02.27" id="18:02.27">18:02.27 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: FYI I'm trying to install roundup from HEAD but not having too much luck - setuptools complained that I was trying to install to somewhere not on PYTHONPATH, so I added it there, then roundup-admin failed with "pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound: The 'roundup==2.0.0' distribution was not found and is required by the application"
* <a href="#18:03.39" id="18:03.39">18:03.39 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I think this is a bit of a sideshow as I can munge things for 2.0, so happy to try anything quick that seems worthwhile, but otherwise I guess I'll drop that for now. I think I could also share our export with you if you wanted to try it out yourself.
* <a href="#18:47.54" id="18:47.54">18:47.54 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I feel confident that I fixed it. The tests failed as you described before I fixed the code. Also in fixing mysql and postgresql imports, I further validated the tests as well as the diagnosis.
* <a href="#18:48.56" id="18:48.56">18:48.56 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: rouilj: ok, cool.
* <a href="#18:48.57" id="18:48.57">18:48.57 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: However the PYTHONPATH thingy is odd. What happens if you do: PYTHONPATH=your_local_install_path python setup.py install --prefix=your_local_install_path?
* <a href="#18:51.00" id="18:51.00">18:51.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also you can use virtualenv, that is apparently recommended. Also pip install --target=your_local_install_path . (when you are in the source directory) should work as well.
* <a href="#18:51.30" id="18:51.30">18:51.30 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume you were running setup.py from the source directory when you got the failure???
* <a href="#18:52.21" id="18:52.21">18:52.21 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: and I got your logging.ini working now
* <a href="#18:53.23" id="18:53.23">18:53.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: setup.py itself succeeded, but roundup-admin in the installation failed
* <a href="#18:54.02" id="18:54.02">18:54.02 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I had PYTHONPATH=/opt/roundup/lib/python2.7/site-packages python2 setup.py install --prefix=/opt/roundup
* <a href="#18:54.12" id="18:54.12">18:54.12 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: which was roughly what the error message I got without having PYTHONPATH told me to do
* <a href="#20:00.12" id="20:00.12">20:00.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, that's broken (sorry dinner time here)
* <a href="#20:00.21" id="20:00.21">20:00.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: cool on logging.ini.
* <a href="#20:00.31" id="20:00.31">20:00.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that should be helpful.
* <a href="#20:02.29" id="20:02.29">20:02.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: is: <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/2868> helpful?
* <a href="#20:02.48" id="20:02.48">20:02.48 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: for macos not debian but...
