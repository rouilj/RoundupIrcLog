# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-06-07
* <a href="#08:53.45" id="08:53.45">08:53.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Taggnostr, can you check your admin email for the roundup tracker platform. The roundup tracker looks like it just dropped a message. The message was forwarded to the nosy list AFAICT, but it's not showing up on disk or in the ticket. I assume there was an error and I am hoping it was sent to you or one of the other admins.
* <a href="#08:54.04" id="08:54.04">08:54.04 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I've never seen this sort of failure before.
* <a href="#08:55.23" id="08:55.23">08:55.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: hey rouilj!  I haven't received any error emails in quite a while
* <a href="#08:55.27" id="08:55.27">08:55.27 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: the last one is from 2020
* <a href="#09:11.41" id="09:11.41">09:11.41 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, ok. How weird. Thanks for looking. it looks like the msgXXXX.tmp files are being left around. In every case except (this) one, the same message message is properly recorded at msgXXXX+1 and linked to it's ticket. How odd.
* <a href="#09:14.09" id="09:14.09">09:14.09 (EDT)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: maybe EWDurbin can help?
* <a href="#16:29.11" id="16:29.11">16:29.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: maybe. I logged in there and I think the issue is a 1.6.1 issue. I can't reproduce it with the current development code using the ame message that I think should trigger the issue. See: <https://issues.roundup-tracker.org/issue2551209>
* <a href="#16:29.59" id="16:29.59">16:29.59 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: taggnostr2 last is for you
