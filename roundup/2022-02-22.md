* <a href="#04:31.00" id="04:31.00">04:31.00 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: seems like <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/f21ec1414591> fixes most of it
* <a href="#07:19.49" id="07:19.49">07:19.49 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: at the bottom of <https://roundup.sourceforge.io/docs/installation.html> there are instructions on howto run the tests, "python -m pytest /test". isnt that slash placed wrong ?
* <a href="#09:14.11" id="09:14.11">09:14.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon aren't you using 2.1.0? That should have that patch already.
* <a href="#09:14.37" id="09:14.37">09:14.37 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yes you are correct about /test. I'll try to fix later today in source.
* <a href="#09:42.23" id="09:42.23">09:42.23 (EST)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: rouilj: no I was still on 2.0.0. Doing a test upgrade on my lab server to 2.1.0, but python setup.py install just stalls with no output..
