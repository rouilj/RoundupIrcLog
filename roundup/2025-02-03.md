# Roundup IRC Log for 2025-02-03
* <a href="#15:24.27" id="15:24.27">15:24.27 (EST)</a> - __[randy_](https://github.com/randy_)__: hey guys. i got my tracker updated to 1.6.1. i used an automated tool to port back_mssqlserver.py from python2 to 3 and stuck it in my backends folder. but when i go to run roundup-server to test, it says "Invalid value for RBMS_BACKEND: 'mssqlserver'. Available backends: anydbm, sqlite". do i have to add mssqlserver somewhere else to make it available as a backend?

* <a href="#16:20.47" id="16:20.47">16:20.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj1](https://github.com/rouilj1)__: note the filename is `__init__.py` double underscores before and after the name. (this note is for the logs which took the underscores for bold text).
