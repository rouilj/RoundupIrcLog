Roundup tries to maintain an auditable record of responses and changes. As a result editing messages (As opposed to deleting/adding a message) is not supported by default.

* <a href="#21:51.10" id="21:51.10">21:51.10 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you need to edit a message to remove say secret info (like a password), the admin can edit the file on disk under tracker_home/db/files/msg/{prefix of msg id}/msg{id}.

You might be able to change it to replace: tal:content="context/author" with tal:content="structure context/author/field" and so on for other fields.  For context/content you might need to do an explicit edit check and use an explicit  textarea tal:content="structure context/content".
* <a href="#22:02.51" id="22:02.51">22:02.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: This is off the top of my head and I can't work on it now.
