# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-06-30
* <a href="#13:01.12" id="13:01.12">13:01.12 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi HedgeMage
* <a href="#13:08.09" id="13:08.09">13:08.09 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: Hey there.
* <a href="#13:19.28" id="13:19.28">13:19.28 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: This is just in the idea stage.  A friend and I were talking about how to do better STEM outreach to poor and rural areas.  One idea that came up was getting closer to the source by doing a series of short workshops by people working in the industry and/or in open source in different roles:
* <a href="#13:19.50" id="13:19.50">13:19.50 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: programmer, architect, security analyst, pentester, QA, and so on as some examples
* <a href="#13:20.37" id="13:20.37">13:20.37 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Similarly, we'd like some variety in language/toolkit and type of programming or technology work being done
* <a href="#13:21.10" id="13:21.10">13:21.10 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: The four big weaknesses we identified in poor/rural areas' STEM outreach are:
* <a href="#13:21.18" id="13:21.18">13:21.18 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 1) Lack of inclusiveness.
* <a href="#13:22.32" id="13:22.32">13:22.32 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: You can only use federal funds for such a program if it's restricted to only girls, only students of color, some subset of students of color, or all of the above.  So, in any case half or more of the students are banned from participating.
* <a href="#13:23.00" id="13:23.00">13:23.00 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: In wealthier areas, they don't need the federal funds, so unless there's a huge ideological slant in the area, everyone has a chance to learn.
* <a href="#13:23.10" id="13:23.10">13:23.10 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 2) Poor quality of instruction
* <a href="#13:23.35" id="13:23.35">13:23.35 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Most instruction is done from canned curricula, by teachers who don't even know enough programming to grade assignments, let alone help the students learn.
* <a href="#13:24.12" id="13:24.12">13:24.12 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Traditionally, programs in these areas can't recruit tech-literate instructors, so they buy a program from a curriculum company that has automated grading of assignments.
* <a href="#13:24.33" id="13:24.33">13:24.33 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: My son took such a class and it was awful.  If he hadn't had a mom who's a programmer, he probably wouldn't have figured it out.
* <a href="#13:24.47" id="13:24.47">13:24.47 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 3) Inadequate access to tools.
* <a href="#13:25.36" id="13:25.36">13:25.36 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Kids tend to be trained in these programs only on the IDEs and/or compilers belonging to the curriculum company, then they can't do more on their own because they can't get licenses to use those tools outside of school.
* <a href="#13:25.44" id="13:25.44">13:25.44 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: The tools aren't as good as open source tools anyway.
* <a href="#13:26.02" id="13:26.02">13:26.02 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 3) Inadequate access to follow-up activities.
* <a href="#13:26.28" id="13:26.28">13:26.28 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: It's all well and good to do a two-day programming workshop, but if you don't get to program apart from an annual workshop, you are unlikely to really learn it.
* <a href="#13:27.09" id="13:27.09">13:27.09 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 1) is easily solved by setting up workshops in an online workshop available to all comers in our target age groups
* <a href="#13:27.39" id="13:27.39">13:27.39 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 2) is solved if we can find enough industry people to help give workshops.
* <a href="#13:28.21" id="13:28.21">13:28.21 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 3) is solved by using and teaching FOSS toolsets
* <a href="#13:29.18" id="13:29.18">13:29.18 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: 4) is the hardest, but perhaps solved if we involve people from FOSS projects that could use some young developers' help, so young programmers can find something to work on, and back that up with some mentorship to help them become good contributors.
* <a href="#13:30.04" id="13:30.04">13:30.04 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: rouilj: Anyway, that's the lay of the land... I'm currently just reaching out to some of my FOSS friends and colleagues to see if there is enough interest to do a workshop series next year.
* <a href="#13:36.51" id="13:36.51">13:36.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Interesting. Regarding 1, I agree on inclusiveness but does your network include women, minorities as well? As a white male, not exactly a role model for those groups.
* <a href="#13:37.25" id="13:37.25">13:37.25 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Our network has a pretty big variety.
* <a href="#13:37.54" id="13:37.54">13:37.54 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Also, I don't buy the argument that you can only be a role model to people who look like you.  Two of my biggest influences in youth were Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln.
* <a href="#13:39.51" id="13:39.51">13:39.51 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Good. Part of the STEM issue IMO is that woman are active discouraged as are minorities. "They can't do math, can't think logically". Having mentors like them seems to be a significant win.
* <a href="#13:40.08" id="13:40.08">13:40.08 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Well, I'm presenting, among others.
* <a href="#13:40.29" id="13:40.29">13:40.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Re 3, yeah. I learned emacs when I was in 7th/8th grade and still use it today. However I do know developers who can't program without prompting from vscode etc. to be able to do anything.
* <a href="#13:40.37" id="13:40.37">13:40.37 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: your presenting ++
* <a href="#13:41.04" id="13:41.04">13:41.04 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Though, I don't think that's as definitive a thing as people claim.  I'm literally the only programmer or infosec person anyone in my hometown knows.  For decades, the school has operated under the assumption that that is a "girl thing".  They aren't churning out a bunch of female coders, or even at the same pace as they do male ones.
* <a href="#13:41.37" id="13:41.37">13:41.37 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I have a college age intern with python experience doing a project with me. She is good and catches on quick but even still roundup has a learning curve.
* <a href="#13:41.46" id="13:41.46">13:41.46 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: *HedgeMage nods.*
* <a href="#13:42.30" id="13:42.30">13:42.30 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Yeah, for the younger kids (7th-8th grade) their ability to give much coding, as opposed to testing and/or documenting, help is usually minimal (though there are outliers).  The high school ones tend to have greater range.
* <a href="#13:42.33" id="13:42.33">13:42.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: i have her working on the "add a welcome message when user logs in" issue. Relatively small project. Visible result.
* <a href="#13:42.40" id="13:42.40">13:42.40 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: *HedgeMage nods.*
* <a href="#13:43.14" id="13:43.14">13:43.14 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Anyway, we're still figuring out if there is enough interest to do this.  I'll put you down in the "interested" column. :)
* <a href="#13:43.20" id="13:43.20">13:43.20 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but environment setup (how do you install mercurial on a mac??) etc takes time.
* <a href="#13:43.27" id="13:43.27">13:43.27 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Yep.
* <a href="#13:43.29" id="13:43.29">13:43.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: def. interested.
* <a href="#13:43.53" id="13:43.53">13:43.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: maybe use pi's with a preconfigured environment for them as support?
* <a href="#13:58.13" id="13:58.13">13:58.13 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Ooh, I hadn't thought of that but it could be a great way to go.
* <a href="#13:58.25" id="13:58.25">13:58.25 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: I will have to look around for funding, but it's a good idea.
* <a href="#13:58.34" id="13:58.34">13:58.34 (EDT)</a> - __[HedgeMage](https://github.com/HedgeMage)__: Maybe my friends at Rural Tech Fund can help.
* <a href="#14:45.04" id="14:45.04">14:45.04 (EDT)</a> - __[bitdancer](https://github.com/bitdancer)__: docker could be useful there, too.  I do all my development inside docker environments these days.
* <a href="#15:53.47" id="15:53.47">15:53.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but where to run it? Also rural areas have crap for connectivity. The pi has the advantage that it can be taken home for work.
