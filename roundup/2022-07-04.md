# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-07-04
* <a href="#01:38.26" id="01:38.26">01:38.26 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc26573](https://github.com/qwebirc26573)__: hi all, is it possible to configure roundup to receive emails from unregistered users? For example allow new tickets, or commenting on tickets, without being registered with an account?
* <a href="#19:29.45" id="19:29.45">19:29.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: qwebirc26573 see: <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/admin_guide.html?highlight=anonymous%20mail> add "Email Registration" permissions for the anonymous role.
* <a href="#19:32.11" id="19:32.11">19:32.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: sorry, make that 'Email Access' not Email Registration. The proper command should be commented out in your tracker's schema.py. (I'll fix the docs that list Registration for the next release.)
* <a href="#19:34.29" id="19:34.29">19:34.29 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: You also need to allow the Anonymous role to Register users. Again see the "Register" permission added to the Anonymous role in schema.py.
* <a href="#19:45.32" id="19:45.32">19:45.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you don't allow anonymous to Register but anonymous has Email Access, the user will get a response email telling them to register using the web interface first.
* <a href="#19:46.36" id="19:46.36">19:46.36 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If somebody does register using email, they can set a password on the same account using the recover password option available on the main page and provide their email address IIRC.
* <a href="#19:48.01" id="19:48.01">19:48.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you will also need to enable the db.security.addPermissionToRole('Anonymous', 'Create', cl) line in schema.py to allow them to create a new issue.
