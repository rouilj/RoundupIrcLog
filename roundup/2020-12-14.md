* <a href="#09:37.49" id="09:37.49">09:37.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: lmsteffan, I only see two calls to decodestring one in roundup_server.py and one in roundup_xmlrpc_server.py. The xmlrpc one is depricated. demo.py uses roundup_server.py so that explains that.
* <a href="#09:38.41" id="09:38.41">09:38.41 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: How did you install? pypi, tarball from sourceforge? I assume you grabbed the tarball?
* <a href="#09:48.16" id="09:48.16">09:48.16 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: 1
* <a href="#09:54.44" id="09:54.44">09:54.44 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: lmsteffan, I responded to you above youc an chekc the log for my response. but the decodestring issue should be fixed on tip in bc2b00afa980. Thanks for raising the issue.
* <a href="#09:55.29" id="09:55.29">09:55.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: the two scripts affected are not included in the test suuite, so our 3.9 ci instance didn't flag it.
* <a href="#09:57.19" id="09:57.19">09:57.19 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: howver I have no other errors in our 3.9 ci chain, so I am not sue what your are seeing. Where is the assertion error? Also the StopIteration errors should be geting trapped by python
* <a href="#09:57.23" id="09:57.23">09:57.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and not exposed.
* <a href="#09:57.55" id="09:57.55">09:57.55 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that's a normal exception generated at end of loop/generator.
* <a href="#09:59.43" id="09:59.43">09:59.43 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: you can see our 3.9 run (called 3.9-dev) of run_tests.py at: https://travis-ci.org/github/roundup-tracker/roundup/builds/746624845
* <a href="#10:05.52" id="10:05.52">10:05.52 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also lmsteffan what is the source of your roundup code? Tarball, hg or git clone, pypi?
* <a href="#10:06.39" id="10:06.39">10:06.39 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: I got it using "hg clone" (after using pypi and seeing some errors)
* <a href="#10:08.03" id="10:08.03">10:08.03 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: I did not see your initial response, I'll check it in the log as soon as it's available.
* <a href="#11:05.40" id="11:05.40">11:05.40 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: it should be in the log. lmc
* <a href="#11:07.02" id="11:07.02">11:07.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yup in the log, but you answered my questions.
* <a href="#11:08.03" id="11:08.03">11:08.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: can you provide some more info on the untrapped exception errors (line numbers, exact error messages, failing test info....)
* <a href="#12:02.04" id="12:02.04">12:02.04 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: sure ! do I copy it here (on IRC) or should I create a new issue or ... ?
* <a href="#13:20.02" id="13:20.02">13:20.02 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: I should mention that all the assertion errors are related to pytest, not to roundup directly. I suspect that these errors are related to PEP 479 which introduced some changes for generators.
* <a href="#13:21.09" id="13:21.09">13:21.09 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: see https://docs.python.org/3.5/whatsnew/3.5.html#pep-479-change-stopiteration-handling-inside-generators
* <a href="#17:20.49" id="17:20.49">17:20.49 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: lsteffan, sorry for the delay. Can you try pip installing pytest and running pytest directly rather than using run_tests.py.
* <a href="#17:22.23" id="17:22.23">17:22.23 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: run_tests.py is an old version of pytest. It is the last version to provide a way to bundle pytest into a standalone python file so you can supply the test runner as part of your app.
* <a href="#17:23.11" id="17:23.11">17:23.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: It may be time to give up on having the distribution being testable without having to pip install pytest.
* <a href="#17:29.50" id="17:29.50">17:29.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I think the reason everything passes in CI is that CI runs: py.test directly not the one bundled in the distribution. That is probably a newer py.test installed at test time with pip.
* <a href="#17:31.52" id="17:31.52">17:31.52 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: Actually I did that - running pytest on the test directory - and it went mostly all right.
* <a href="#17:32.57" id="17:32.57">17:32.57 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: One error does occur when pytz is not installed:
* <a href="#17:33.48" id="17:33.48">17:33.48 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: E           AssertionError: OptionValueError not raised by set
* <a href="#17:33.51" id="17:33.51">17:33.51 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: test/test_config.py:117: AssertionError
* <a href="#17:34.42" id="17:34.42">17:34.42 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: and disappears when pytz is installed.
* <a href="#17:37.07" id="17:37.07">17:37.07 (EST)</a> - __[lmsteffan](https://github.com/lmsteffan)__: For what it's worth, I think that (at least on Linux) it's so easy to install pytest and run the tests that I don't ses much added value in having a bundled test runner. Besides, it seems to be brittle with respect to Python version changes, doesn't it ?
* <a href="#19:59.42" id="19:59.42">19:59.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: well it has survived from python 2.3 till python 3.8 so .... but with the support being withdrawn (they claimed it wasn't a used feature) it's time to revise the docs and get rid of it I guess. Unless EWDurbin, jerrykan[m]  or Taggnostr (they are part of the python dev team) have any ideas on how to make testing roundup self-contained.
* <a href="#20:03.03" id="20:03.03">20:03.03 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: I feel a bit bad that I migrated the test runner over to pytest and implement using some of its features in the test suite now
* <a href="#20:06.47" id="20:06.47">20:06.47 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: However, I think given that venv/pip make it very easy to use 3rd party packages these days, generally speaking I think it is more of maintenance burden to not take advantage of the 3rd party tools that are out there... especially for project maintainers.
* <a href="#20:13.48" id="20:13.48">20:13.48 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] so you are recommendeing deletion of run_test.py and rewriting all references to it to start with 'install pytest' and then s/run_test.py/py.test/
* <a href="#20:14.45" id="20:14.45">20:14.45 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also lmsteffan, what error was thrown when pytz was missing. The test suite may need an additional @skip_pytz on a test somewhere.
* <a href="#20:15.03" id="20:15.03">20:15.03 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: oh like 117 of test_config.py looking.
* <a href="#20:16.01" id="20:16.01">20:16.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah yes. Need to split that function I think.
* <a href="#20:16.26" id="20:16.26">20:16.26 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: Generally speaking, yes, however I haven't been actively involved with roundup development for many years, so my opinion should only carry the appropriate weight of "not much"
* <a href="#20:20.01" id="20:20.01">20:20.01 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah but you have more python knowledge than I do so....
* <a href="#20:20.39" id="20:20.39">20:20.39 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: also not sure how to fix test_config.py. It looks like it should be working right. Guess I'll have to hide pytz and see if I can figure out what's happening.
* <a href="#20:21.42" id="20:21.42">20:21.42 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: with there was a way to make import pytz to fail for the test without having to actually remove the pytz module.
* <a href="#20:23.31" id="20:23.31">20:23.31 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: would be nice to test cases where we have functionality that is optional if the library exists. IIRC we tst with all the bells and whistles. Some code that is the fallback is never tested.
* <a href="#20:26.34" id="20:26.34">20:26.34 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: I believe the mysql/postgres tests should already do conditional testing. I might be worth having a look in those test files for an example
* <a href="#20:27.32" id="20:27.32">20:27.32 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: This section in particular https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup/blob/master/test/test_mysql.py#L49
* <a href="#20:27.33" id="20:27.33">20:27.33 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: They elide the tests marking them as skipped if the import fails. I need to make the import fail even if the library is installed.
* <a href="#20:28.09" id="20:28.09">20:28.09 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: oh, I think there might be a pytest option to set specific marks
* <a href="#20:28.12" id="20:28.12">20:28.12 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah your link confirms what I thought.
* <a href="#20:29.46" id="20:29.46">20:29.46 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If I run pytest on a system that does have pytz installed, I will run pytz tests. What I want to do is run on the same system but have pytz fail to import when I run part of the roundup code that does an import pytz.
* <a href="#20:30.19" id="20:30.19">20:30.19 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: so I can test the codepaths that use pytz and the code paths that don't run if pytz loads.
* <a href="#20:30.21" id="20:30.21">20:30.21 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: ah
* <a href="#20:31.02" id="20:31.02">20:31.02 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also using a standard test framework is a good thing. No need to feel bad.
* <a href="#20:31.37" id="20:31.37">20:31.37 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: might be better to push that sort of testing out to the CI (ie. multiple CI runs with different dependencies installed)
* <a href="#20:34.11" id="20:34.11">20:34.11 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I considered that, but there are a lot of tests that are not dependent on optional packages. Those tests would be run for every environment (16 or so) and just waste cycles.
* <a href="#20:40.33" id="20:40.33">20:40.33 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: on the "extra" runs you could just run specific tests. pytest supports running specific tests files, or use `-k` if you want something more fine-grained
* <a href="#20:41.49" id="20:41.49">20:41.49 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: one of the problems with trying to implement some sort of work-around in the test suite itself is how do you test the work-around is doing/testing what you think it is doing/testing
* <a href="#20:41.51" id="20:41.51">20:41.51 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: yeah I could. Would need to figure out how to make that matrix test work in travisci. I have failed on making that work before when I was trying to set up different test runs for testing 1.6.1 and the tip
* <a href="#20:43.09" id="20:43.09">20:43.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: "how do you test the" insert import pdb; pdb.set_trace() during development 8-). That's what I am doing now to try to figure out why the test is failing without pytz.
* <a href="#20:43.21" id="20:43.21">20:43.21 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: :D
* <a href="#20:44.30" id="20:44.30">20:44.30 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: yeah, I don't remember the matrix stuff being the most intuitive when I last played with it. I haven't touched travisci stuff in a very long time, I mainly use GitLab CI these days.
* <a href="#20:46.09" id="20:46.09">20:46.09 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hmm, care to help spin up a gilab ci env for testing? We have travis and circleci why not go for three....
* <a href="#20:47.03" id="20:47.03">20:47.03 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: and another mirror :D
* <a href="#20:47.29" id="20:47.29">20:47.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: oh gitlab not git hub. yeah sure.....
* <a href="#20:48.09" id="20:48.09">20:48.09 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: yeah, I haven't touched the GitHub actions stuff at all.
* <a href="#20:49.19" id="20:49.19">20:49.19 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: hmmm the `roundup` namespace is available on GitLab. Might be worth nabbing that
* <a href="#20:50.01" id="20:50.01">20:50.01 (EST)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: the unofficial mirror of the unofficial mirror :D
* <a href="#20:51.47" id="20:51.47">20:51.47 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Feel free to nab IMO. Even if it's just held as a placeholder.
* <a href="#21:19.54" id="21:19.54">21:19.54 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: grr, got the test sorted but I am getting a deprication error for using the imp module. Looks like it's a leftover from when there was a config.py. So pre 1.0 roundup??? Sadly mapping imp.find_module and imp.load_module to importlib is not trivial. Looks like ther replacements take different arguments.
* <a href="#21:27.36" id="21:27.36">21:27.36 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: lmsteffan that error without pytz should be resolved. The failing test should have passed without an exception. Looks like it never got run (probably because everybody installs pytz).
* <a href="#21:27.52" id="21:27.52">21:27.52 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: checkin: 6cf9f2f49b89
