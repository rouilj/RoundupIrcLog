* <a href="#04:07.58" id="04:07.58">04:07.58 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Heffalump: hehe, im also in the process to start planning an upgrade from 1.4 to 2.0, whit aloot of custom code that needs to be converted to python3 :/
* <a href="#04:11.23" id="04:11.23">04:11.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I haven't even started to look at our custom code or mail flows yet :-(
* <a href="#04:13.18" id="04:13.18">04:13.18 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: :/
* <a href="#04:13.37" id="04:13.37">04:13.37 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: anyway, I guess the initial migration will be to python2 given the above.
* <a href="#04:14.02" id="04:14.02">04:14.02 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I could plausibly then do a second migration to python3 if roundup 2.0 + python2 doesn't write out the same format
