# Roundup IRC Log for 2021-05-31
* <a href="#04:07.58" id="04:07.58">04:07.58 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: Heffalump: hehe, im also in the process to start planning an upgrade from 1.4 to 2.0, whit aloot of custom code that needs to be converted to python3 :/
* <a href="#04:11.23" id="04:11.23">04:11.23 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I haven't even started to look at our custom code or mail flows yet :-(
* <a href="#04:13.18" id="04:13.18">04:13.18 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: :/
* <a href="#04:13.37" id="04:13.37">04:13.37 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: anyway, I guess the initial migration will be to python2 given the above.
* <a href="#04:14.02" id="04:14.02">04:14.02 (EDT)</a> - __[Heffalump](https://github.com/Heffalump)__: I could plausibly then do a second migration to python3 if roundup 2.0 + python2 doesn't write out the same format
* <a href="#23:14.31" id="23:14.31">23:14.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: If you ae upgrading, what I would do is upgrade using 2.0. Then export using roundup-admin with python2. Then import using roundup-admin using python 3. Depending on the size it may take a while and disk space is also a concern.
* <a href="#23:15.06" id="23:15.06">23:15.06 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: oh sorry. misread. you are asking about the journal.
* <a href="#23:15.33" id="23:15.33">23:15.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: journal of an export that is.
* <a href="#23:22.46" id="23:22.46">23:22.46 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Heffalump, I assume you are using mysql backend?
* <a href="#23:25.39" id="23:25.39">23:25.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also did you export the tracker using roundup 2.0.0 under python2 or did you export using 1.4? IIRC export/import is only supported for the same version of roundup. So a 1.4 export and 2.0 import is not supposed to work.
* <a href="#23:32.24" id="23:32.24">23:32.24 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I assume you are looking for a description of the format of a -journals.csv file. The high level description of what they are for is "a series of tuples that record the changes to the items in the class over time". There should be 5 : separated fields.  class item id: date tuple : user id : action: extra data.
* <a href="#23:32.44" id="23:32.44">23:32.44 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: E.G. '2':(2013, 2, 20, 5, 4, 49.453, 0, 0, 0):'1':'set':"{'nosy': (('+', ['2', '3']),)}"
* <a href="#23:33.58" id="23:33.58">23:33.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: item 2 was changed on feb 20, 2013 at 5:04:49 by the admin user. The admin user set nosy to id 2 and 3.
* <a href="#23:34.32" id="23:34.32">23:34.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: This was done using 2.x under python 3, but it should be similar for python2 and ealier versions.
* <a href="#23:36.00" id="23:36.00">23:36.00 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: hope that helps.
