# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-08-31
* <a href="#16:25.40" id="16:25.40">16:25.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ack jerrykan[m] I screwed up the hg -> git sync mechanism to github. It's refusing to do ff anymore. Ideas on how to unbork it?
* <a href="#16:26.01" id="16:26.01">16:26.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I added a new workflow to the git repo using github.
* <a href="#16:28.39" id="16:28.39">16:28.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and that caused things to diverge. I thought I got them back in sync (git fetch, check in workflow in hg, merge (non-ff) the HG copy of the workflow into my git repo. I have a feeling a --force is needed somewhere here to resync the repo's (if it can be done). Any ideas?
* <a href="#16:32.32" id="16:32.32">16:32.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: <https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup/commits/master> and <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/default/tree>/  .github/workflows/anchore.yml is the commit whre things went wrong.  commit 983d9bd4 on git side and 3387f4 was my atempt to recover on the mercurial side.
* <a href="#16:44.39" id="16:44.39">16:44.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I just pulled a copy of my GIT repo from backups from before github messed with it.
* <a href="#16:49.40" id="16:49.40">16:49.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I suspect I can force push that copy then merge --fast-forward from hg and get back to a working order???
* <a href="#16:55.50" id="16:55.50">16:55.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I created a playground copy of my git repo from before the change on github. I was able to successfully fetch/merge -ff-only. So I claim I have a copy of the git repo in a form that I want.
* <a href="#16:57.03" id="16:57.03">16:57.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: can I just push --force to make github's copy up to date? If so, what effect will that have on travis-ci if any? Will its copy of the repo (assuming it has one) be confused?
* <a href="#20:43.17" id="20:43.17">20:43.17 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: anybody else have some git fu and can advise?
* <a href="#21:05.06" id="21:05.06">21:05.06 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: rouilj: Yeah, a forced push sounds like what you are after. I would do a `git checkout master && git reset --hard <commit of hg tip>` then you should be able to do a `git push origin master` (assuming GitHub is your `origin` remote)
* <a href="#21:06.05" id="21:06.05">21:06.05 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: not that doing`git reset --hard` will be a destructive action if you have any local uncommitted changes
* <a href="#21:11.38" id="21:11.38">21:11.38 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I do  git push github master, git fetch pulls from hg
* <a href="#21:11.47" id="21:11.47">21:11.47 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] last for you
* <a href="#21:12.37" id="21:12.37">21:12.37 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: üëçÔ∏è
* <a href="#21:12.53" id="21:12.53">21:12.53 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: if I have a git repo up to date with hg, I can't push to github because of the addition of the workflow file.
* <a href="#21:13.05" id="21:13.05">21:13.05 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: What was your last emoji?

* <a href="#21:20.04" id="21:20.04">21:20.04 (EDT)</a> - __[jerrykan[m]](https://github.com/jerrykan[m])__: sorry, people distracting me at work, I forgot the `-f`. It should be `git push github master -f`
* <a href="#21:20.31" id="21:20.31">21:20.31 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I did git push --force github master to get the error.

* <a href="#21:22.35" id="21:22.35">21:22.35 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: then I should be able o do a git fetch, merge --fast-forward and push and be back in business right?
* <a href="#21:23.54" id="21:23.54">21:23.54 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: that seems to have done the trick.
