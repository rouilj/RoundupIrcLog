# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-08-31
* <a href="#16:25.40" id="16:25.40">16:25.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Ack jerrykan[m] I screwed up the hg -> git sync mechanism to github. It's refusing to do ff anymore. Ideas on how to unbork it?
* <a href="#16:26.01" id="16:26.01">16:26.01 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I added a new workflow to the git repo using github.
* <a href="#16:28.39" id="16:28.39">16:28.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: and that caused things to diverge. I thought I got them back in sync (git fetch, check in workflow in hg, merge (non-ff) the HG copy of the workflow into my git repo. I have a feeling a --force is needed somewhere here to resync the repo's (if it can be done). Any ideas?
* <a href="#16:32.32" id="16:32.32">16:32.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: <https://github.com/roundup-tracker/roundup/commits/master> and <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/code/ci/default/tree>/  .github/workflows/anchore.yml is the commit whre things went wrong.  commit 983d9bd4 on git side and 3387f4 was my atempt to recover on the mercurial side.
* <a href="#16:44.39" id="16:44.39">16:44.39 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I just pulled a copy of my GIT repo from backups from before github messed with it.
* <a href="#16:49.40" id="16:49.40">16:49.40 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I suspect I can force push that copy then merge --fast-forward from hg and get back to a working order???
* <a href="#16:55.50" id="16:55.50">16:55.50 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I created a playground copy of my git repo from before the change on github. I was able to successfully fetch/merge -ff-only. So I claim I have a copy of the git repo in a form that I want.
* <a href="#16:57.03" id="16:57.03">16:57.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: can I just push --force to make github's copy up to date? If so, what effect will that have on travis-ci if any? Will its copy of the repo (assuming it has one) be confused?
