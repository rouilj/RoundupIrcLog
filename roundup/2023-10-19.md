* <a href="#17:34.03" id="17:34.03">17:34.03 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: jerrykan[m] does gitlab support running jobs under python2? The regular python setup action on github stopped supporting python2 a few months ago. I was using travis, but I am having issues with it reporting to codecov and am concerned how much longer it will support opensource.
