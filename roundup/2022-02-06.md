# Roundup IRC Log for 2022-02-06
* <a href="#15:10.52" id="15:10.52">15:10.52 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: EWDurbin, Taggnostr you guys get admin email from the b.p.o, roundup, jython etc. trackers right? Can you check to see if there is any email from the roundup tracker. Something wacky seems to have happened. It skipped issue numbers 2551192 and 2551194 while creating 1,3,5 and sending email that ...4 was created. While I like odd numbers, this seems a bit well.... odd?

* <a href="#15:13.04" id="15:13.04">15:13.04 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: a lot of these, but they are old

* <a href="#15:13.26" id="15:13.26">15:13.26 (EST)</a> - __[Taggnostr](https://github.com/Taggnostr)__: so maybe I don't get emails anymore :)
* <a href="#15:16.28" id="15:16.28">15:16.28 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Hi Taggnostr, this would have been today. Less then an hour ago.
* <a href="#15:17.29" id="15:17.29">15:17.29 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: but that does point to a bad password entry in the database.
* <a href="#15:23.10" id="15:23.10">15:23.10 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I'll bet a user whose account was created only by email was trying to log in.
* <a href="#15:24.50" id="15:24.50">15:24.50 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: just dumped the user table for the roundup tracker and have a bunch of people without any hashed password. I wonder if I can augment that error to give a username/id number.
* <a href="#15:25.19" id="15:25.19">15:25.19 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: actually it may be moot given that cgi is getting deprecated but...
* <a href="#15:30.14" id="15:30.14">15:30.14 (EST)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: ah that code is protected by a try/except that handles the ValueError in 1.6.1 and newer. Also for the record that's  bad Authentication header sent from the client.
