* <a href="#06:51.12" id="06:51.12">06:51.12 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: Hello, I am trying to update my issue tracker from 1.3.3 to 2.2.0, what would be the easiest way of doing that?

* <a href="#06:57.00" id="06:57.00">06:57.00 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: qwebirc6653: that's quite a feat :D
* <a href="#06:57.16" id="06:57.16">06:57.16 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: qwebirc6653: I upgrade ours from 1.4.20 some year ago to 2.x

* <a href="#06:57.47" id="06:57.47">06:57.47 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: basically, reading every upgrade step at <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>

* <a href="#06:58.42" id="06:58.42">06:58.42 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: and testing everything between every single relase. And special attention when going moving to from 1.6 to 2.0 for the python3 support, which was our end goal

* <a href="#07:00.54" id="07:00.54">07:00.54 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: I see so essentially I just go throough each update individually?
