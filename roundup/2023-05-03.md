* <a href="#06:51.12" id="06:51.12">06:51.12 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: Hello, I am trying to update my issue tracker from 1.3.3 to 2.2.0, what would be the easiest way of doing that?

* <a href="#06:57.00" id="06:57.00">06:57.00 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: qwebirc6653: that's quite a feat :D
* <a href="#06:57.16" id="06:57.16">06:57.16 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: qwebirc6653: I upgrade ours from 1.4.20 some year ago to 2.x

* <a href="#06:57.47" id="06:57.47">06:57.47 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: basically, reading every upgrade step at <https://www.roundup-tracker.org/docs/upgrading.html>

* <a href="#06:58.42" id="06:58.42">06:58.42 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: and testing everything between every single relase. And special attention when going moving to from 1.6 to 2.0 for the python3 support, which was our end goal

* <a href="#07:00.54" id="07:00.54">07:00.54 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: I see so essentially I just go throough each update individually?

* <a href="#07:01.59" id="07:01.59">07:01.59 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: does that mean i would need to go through all the 1.4.x updates or can i just do 1.4.x to 1.4.17? also I dont see any update to get from 1.4.21 to 1.5.0?

* <a href="#07:07.53" id="07:07.53">07:07.53 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I moved from 1.4.21 to 1.5.1 in one go. Downloaded the 1.5.1 tar ball, extracted, ran run_tests.py, then python setup.py install, su to roundup user, executed roundup-admin migrate to check for any db migrations and replaced all self.client.error_message.append to self.client.add_error_message, according to the documentation for Migrating from 1.5.0 to 1.5.1

* <a href="#07:12.29" id="07:12.29">07:12.29 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I would recommend consulting the Roundup mailing lists, <https://sourceforge.net/p/roundup/mailman>/  it's worth a subscribe to ask for help, this channel is not super active

* <a href="#07:33.55" id="07:33.55">07:33.55 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: so just to be sure, do i need to go through all the 1.4.x updates until 1.4.17, or can I just go straight to 1.4.17

* <a href="#08:05.49" id="08:05.49">08:05.49 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I don't know. I did every upgrade

* <a href="#08:10.01" id="08:10.01">08:10.01 (EDT)</a> - __[nomicon](https://github.com/nomicon)__: I was very new to Roundup when I was tasked to have it running under python3, so I was very cautios

* <a href="#09:30.43" id="09:30.43">09:30.43 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc6653](https://github.com/qwebirc6653)__: I see, Thank you for your help

* <a href="#10:18.59" id="10:18.59">10:18.59 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: nomicon, your advise was pretty much spot on. Although it should be possible to just backup the tracker and data, get the 2.2.0 tarball and install it in a new virtual env. Then do all the upgrading steps and start the 2.2.0 'roundup-admin -i .. migrate' and then enable the mail gateway and web server.

* <a href="#10:24.33" id="10:24.33">10:24.33 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: However, we never test upgrading a live tracker that way. The test suite does test migration paths from database version 5 (roundup v2.0.0)  to version 8 (current will be 2.3.0).

* <a href="#10:26.25" id="10:26.25">10:26.25 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Starting from 1.3.3 (2007) to now is 15 years of updates, so your more conservative approach is a better idea.

* <a href="#10:27.42" id="10:27.42">10:27.42 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I rewrote the generic upgrading instructions. Given this discussion, I am going to make a couple of changes to it.
* <a href="#10:27.58" id="10:27.58">10:27.58 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Thanks for stepping in to help out another roundup user.

* <a href="#10:30.45" id="10:30.45">10:30.45 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: Also I moved the directions for upgrade pre 1.5.0 (10 years ago 2013) to a separate document to reduce download times for most upgraders. Cut the size of the doc in half.

* <a href="#10:31.21" id="10:31.21">10:31.21 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: I wonder how many people deployed roundup and i has just worked for them so they saw no need to upgrade over more than one decade....
* <a href="#10:31.32" id="10:31.32">10:31.32 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: s/i has/it has/

* <a href="#12:37.18" id="12:37.18">12:37.18 (EDT)</a> - __[qwebirc45819](https://github.com/qwebirc45819)__: Hello, I am trying to find out if there is a quick way of updating my issue tracker from 1.3.3 to 2.2.0, do I need to go through each update individially or can I just download the newest version and move everything to that?

* <a href="#13:07.11" id="13:07.11">13:07.11 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: bah,
* <a href="#13:07.16" id="13:07.16">13:07.16 (EDT)</a> - __[rouilj](https://github.com/rouilj)__: missed him/her
